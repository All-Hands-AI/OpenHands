## Papers

1. **Title:** U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
   **Authors:** Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, Thomas Brox
   **Year:** 2015
   **Summary:** This paper introduces U-Net, a convolutional neural network designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation. The U-Net architecture is characterized by its U-shaped structure, which enables it to capture context and localize accurately. This model has significantly improved performance in segmenting biomedical images and has become a foundational model in medical image analysis.

2. **Title:** V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation
   **Authors:** Fausto Milletari, Nassir Navab, Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi
   **Year:** 2016
   **Summary:** V-Net extends the concept of fully convolutional networks to 3D image volumes, allowing for effective segmentation of volumetric images. This paper demonstrates the V-Net architecture's capabilities in handling 3D data, improving upon previous models and providing a robust solution for volumetric medical image segmentation.
