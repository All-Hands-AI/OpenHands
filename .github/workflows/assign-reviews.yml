                # Need Reviewer Action

                Find all open PRs where:
                1. The PR is waiting for review (there are no open review comments or change requests)
                2. The PR is in a "clean" state (CI passing, no merge conflicts)
                3. The PR is not marked as draft (draft: false)
                4. The PR has had no activity (comments, commits, reviews) for more than 3 days.

                In this case, send a message to the reviewers:
                [Automatic Post]: This PR seems to be currently waiting for review.
                {reviewer_names}, could you please take a look when you have a chance?

                # Need Author Action

                Find all open PRs where the most recent change or comment was made on the pull
                request more than 5 days ago (use 14 days if the PR is marked as draft).

                And send a message to the author:

                [Automatic Post]: It has been a while since there was any activity on this PR.
                {author}, are you still working on it? If so, please go ahead, if not then
                please request review, close it, or request that someone else follow up.

                # Need Reviewers

                Find all open pull requests that TRULY have NO reviewers assigned. To do this correctly:

                1. Use the GitHub API to fetch PR details: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}
                2. Check the "requested_reviewers" and "requested_teams" arrays
                3. ALSO check for submitted reviews: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews
                4. A PR needs reviewers ONLY if ALL of these are true:
                   - The "requested_reviewers" array is empty (no pending review requests)
                   - The "requested_teams" array is empty (no pending team review requests)
                   - The reviews array is empty (no reviews have been submitted yet)
                5. IMPORTANT: If ANY of these has entries, SKIP this PR - it already has or had reviewers!

                Example API responses showing a PR that DOES NOT need reviewers (skip this):

                Case 1 - Has requested reviewers:
                GET /pulls/{number}: {"requested_reviewers": [{"login": "someuser"}], "requested_teams": []}

                Case 2 - Has submitted reviews (even if requested_reviewers is empty):
                GET /pulls/{number}: {"requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": []}
                GET /pulls/{number}/reviews: [{"user": {"login": "someuser"}, "state": "COMMENTED"}]

                Example API response showing a PR that DOES need reviewers (process this):
                GET /pulls/{number}: {"requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": []}
                GET /pulls/{number}/reviews: []

                Additional criteria for PRs that need reviewers:
                1. Are not marked as draft (draft: false)
                2. Were created more than 1 day ago
                3. CI is passing and there are no merge conflicts

                For each PR that truly has NO reviewers, read the git blame information for the files,
                and find the most recent and active contributors to the file/location of the changes.
                Assign one of these people as a reviewer, but try not to assign too many reviews to
                any single person. Add this message:

                [Automatic Post]: I have assigned {reviewer} as a reviewer based on git blame information.
                Thanks in advance for the help!
