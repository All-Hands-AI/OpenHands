## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software
to do everything you might do with the software that would
otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any
permitted purpose.  However, you may only make changes or
new works based on the software according to [Changes and New
Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license), and you may
not distribute copies of the software.

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any
permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## Free Trial

Use of the software for more than 30 days per calendar year is not allowed without a commercial license.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

If you violate any of these terms, or do anything with the
software not covered by your licenses, all your licenses
end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
