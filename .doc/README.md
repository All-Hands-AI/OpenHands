# Design Documentation

This `.doc/` directory houses design documents that are useful for:

- **Guiding agent work** on particular features during development
- **Explaining features in depth** for the benefit of code reviewers
- **Providing context and architectural decisions** for complex implementations

These design documents are typically used in feature branches to help maintain
consistency and understanding throughout the development process. They may be
omitted from the main branch to keep the repository clean while preserving the
valuable context they provide during active development.
