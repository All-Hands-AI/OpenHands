# Brainstorming Data Architecture for LLM/GPT Agent Interactions

This document outlines a proposed data architecture designed to optimize the interaction between services and databases within an application leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) and GPT agents. The focus is on ensuring efficient data handling, storage, and retrieval processes to support dynamic, intelligent agent activities.

## Architectural Overview

The architecture is designed around the principle of utilizing specific databases for distinct aspects of the application's functionality, ensuring that data flow is optimized for both performance and scalability.

### Redis as the First Responder for LLM Computation

- **Role**: Caches results from frequent LLM computations to quickly serve repeat requests without re-computing.
- **Data Model**: Key-value pairs where the key is a hash of the query and the model parameters, and the value is the LLM output.

### PostgreSQL for Knowledge Base and Extended Context

- **Role**: Acts as a repository for the application's knowledge base and extended context, supporting complex queries for LLM inference enhancement.
- **Data Model**:
  - `KnowledgeBase`: Stores articles, documents, and data snippets.
    - Columns: `ID`, `Title`, `Content`, `Tags`, `CreatedAt`.
  - `Context`: Stores contextual information for enhancing LLM responses.
    - Columns: `ContextID`, `ContextData`, `UsageCount`, `LastUsedAt`.

### MongoDB for Storing Reports and Code Generation Documents

- **Role**: Stores unstructured data such as reports and documents generated by the LLM/GPT agent.
- **Data Model**:
```json
{
  "DocumentID": "UUID",
  "Type": "Report | Code",
  "Content": "String | JSON",
  "GeneratedBy": "AgentID",
  "CreatedAt": "DateTime"
}
```

### MySQL for Process State Updates Visible on the Web

- **Role**: Manages data related to the state of various processes undertaken by agents, accessible via web interfaces.
- **Data Model**:
  - `ProcessStates`: Tracks the state of processes.
    - Columns: `ProcessID`, `AgentID`, `State`, `UpdatedAt`.

## Interaction Flow

1. **LLM/GPT Request Handling**:
   - A request is first checked against Redis to see if a recent, relevant computation exists.
   - If not found in Redis, the request is processed, potentially utilizing PostgreSQL for extended context or specific knowledge base queries.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Results from LLM/GPT computations that produce reports or code documents are stored in MongoDB.
   - Process states, especially those that need to be displayed on the web interface, are updated in MySQL.

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - For subsequent requests, Redis serves any cached results.
   - For new or complex queries requiring deep context, PostgreSQL is queried.
   - MongoDB serves requests for accessing generated reports or documents.
   - MySQL provides process state information for web interfaces.

This architecture aims to leverage the strengths of each database technology to support the efficient operation of LLM/GPT agents within the application, ensuring fast response times, scalability, and robust data management capabilities.
