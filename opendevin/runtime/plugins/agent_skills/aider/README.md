# Aider is AI pair programming in your terminal

Aider lets you pair program with LLMs,
to edit code in your local git repository.

Please see the [original repository](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) for more information.

OpenDevin has adapted and integrated its linter module ([original code](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/blob/main/aider/linter.py)).
