This sentence contains several typos and grammatical errors. Can you spot them all? It's not as easy as it seems.
Some common words are misspelled, like 'their' instead of 'there', or 'your' instead of 'you're'.
Additionally, punctuation might be missing or misused; for example, a semicolon might be used instead of a comma.
Lastly, watch out for homophones, such as 'to', 'too', and 'two'; 'their', 'there', and 'they're'; 'its' and 'it's'.
