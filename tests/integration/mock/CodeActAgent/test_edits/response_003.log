Let's fix the typos in the `bad.txt` file.

1. "stupid typoo" should be "stupid typo".
2. "No mor typos!" should be "No more typos!".

I will make these corrections now.

edit_file_by_replace(
    '/workspace/bad.txt',
    to_replace="This is a stupid typoo.",
    new_content="This is a stupid typo."
)
