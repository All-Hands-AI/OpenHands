Some common words are misspelled, like 'their' insted of 'there', or 'your' insted of 'you're'.
Additionally, punctuation might be missing or misused; for example, a semicolon might be used insted of a comma.
Lastly, watch out for homophones, such as 'to', 'too', and 'two'; 'their', 'there', and 'they're'; 'its' and 'it's'.
