I will correct the typos in the `bad.txt` file. Here are the changes I will make:
1. "typoo" to "typo"
2. "mor" to "more"

Let's edit the file accordingly.
<execute_ipython>
EDITED_CONTENT = """This is a stupid typo.
Really?
No more typos!
Enjoy!"""
edit_file('bad.txt', start=1, end=4, content=EDITED_CONTENT)
