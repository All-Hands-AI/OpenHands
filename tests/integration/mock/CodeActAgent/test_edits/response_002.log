Thank you for showing me the contents of the file. I can see there are a few typos that need to be fixed. I'll correct them one by one.

Let's start with the first line:

<execute_ipython>
edit_file(
    'bad.txt',
    to_replace="This is a stupid typoo.",
    new_content="This is a stupid typo."
)
