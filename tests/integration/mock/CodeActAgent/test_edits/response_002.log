Let's correct the typos in the `bad.txt` file.

<execute_ipython>
edit_file('bad.txt', start=1, end=4, content="""This is a stupid typo.
Really?
No more typos!
Enjoy!""")
</execute_ipython>
[File updated. Please review the changes and make sure they are correct (correct indentation, no duplicate lines, etc). Edit the file again if necessary.]
