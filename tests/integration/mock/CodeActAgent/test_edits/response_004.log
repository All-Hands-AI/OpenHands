It seems that the `edit` command is not available in this environment as well. Let's try a different approach to fix the typos in the file `bad.txt`. I will overwrite the content of the file with the corrected text:
<execute_bash>
echo "This is a stupid typo.
Really?
No more typos!
Enjoy!" > bad.txt
