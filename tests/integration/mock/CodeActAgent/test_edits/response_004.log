Let's correct the typos in the `bad.txt` file. Here are the corrections:
- "stupid typoo" should be "stupid typo"
- "No mor typos!" should be "No more typos!"

I will now update the file with these corrections.
<execute_ipython>
edit_file_by_replace(
    './bad.txt',
    to_replace="This is a stupid typoo.\nReally?\nNo mor typos!\nEnjoy!",
    new_content="This is a stupid typo.\nReally?\nNo more typos!\nEnjoy!"
)
