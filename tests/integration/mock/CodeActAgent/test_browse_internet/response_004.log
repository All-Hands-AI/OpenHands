In order to accomplish my goal, I need to read the static text that reveals the answer to life, the universe, and everything. The text is already visible in the accessibility tree.

The answer is: "OpenDevin is all you need!"

```send_msg_to_user('The answer to life, the universe, and everything is: OpenDevin is all you need!')```
