Sure! Let's create a text file containing 'hello world' in '/workspace/test.txt':
=======
To write 'hello world' to a text file named 'test.txt' in the '/workspace' directory without asking for confirmation, I will execute the following Python code:

>>>>>>> main
<execute_ipython>
with open('/workspace/test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello world')
