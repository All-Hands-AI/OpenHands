The kernel has been successfully restarted. Now, I will import the pandas package again, create a DataFrame with the names 'Alice' and 'Bob', and write it to the file '/workspace/names.txt'. Let's proceed with creating the DataFrame and writing it to the file:

<execute_ipython>
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with the names 'Alice' and 'Bob'
df = pd.DataFrame({'Names': ['Alice', 'Bob']})

# Write the DataFrame to a text file
df.to_csv('/workspace/names.txt', index=False)
