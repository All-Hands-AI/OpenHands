Great, the pandas library has been installed successfully. Now, let's import pandas and create a DataFrame with the specified names. After that, we'll write the DataFrame to the '/workspace/names.txt' file.
<execute_ipython>
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Names': ['Alice', 'Bob']})

# Write the DataFrame to a file
df.to_csv('/workspace/names.txt', index=False)
