It seems that the pandas package is not recognized after installation. Let me restart the kernel to ensure the package is properly loaded, and then I will import pandas and create the DataFrame again. Let's proceed with restarting the kernel:

<execute_ipython>
import IPython
IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)  # Restart the kernel
