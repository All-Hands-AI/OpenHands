Let's proceed with installing and importing `pymsgbox` version 1.0.9 and printing its version to a file named `test.txt` in the `/workspace` directory.


```
pythonCopy code`<execute_ipython>
%pip install pymsgbox==1.0.9
import pymsgbox
with open('/workspace/test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(pymsgbox.__version__)
</execute_ipython>`
```
This code will install `pymsgbox` version 1.0.9, import it, and then write its version number to the file `test.txt` in the `/workspace` directory. Let's proceed!
