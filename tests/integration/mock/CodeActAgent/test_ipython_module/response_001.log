Understood! Let's proceed by installing the `pymsgbox` package version 1.0.9:


```
pythonCopy code`<execute_ipython>
# Install pymsgbox version 1.0.9
%pip install pymsgbox==1.0.9
</execute_ipython>`
```
Once the installation is complete, we'll import `pymsgbox` and print its version to a file named `test.txt` in the `/workspace` directory. Let's continue!
