It seems there was an issue with the exact match. I will correct the typos line by line instead.

1. "This is a stupid typoo." should be "This is a stupid typo."
2. "No mor typos!" should be "No more typos!".

Let's proceed with these changes.
<execute_ipython>
edit_file_by_replace(
    "bad.txt",
    to_replace="This is a stupid typoo.",
    new_content="This is a stupid typo."
)
