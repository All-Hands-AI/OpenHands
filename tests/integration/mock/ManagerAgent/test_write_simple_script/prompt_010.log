## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[[{"source": "user", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "Write a shell script 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.", "wait_for_response": false}}, {"observation": "null", "content": "", "extras": {}}], [{"source": "agent", "action": "delegate", "args": {"agent": "CoderAgent", "inputs": {"task": "Write a shell script 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'.", "summary": ""}, "thought": "", "is_confirmed": "confirmed"}}, {"observation": "null", "content": "", "extras": {}}], [{"action": "null", "args": {}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "delegate", "content": "", "extras": {"outputs": {}}}], [{"source": "agent", "action": "delegate", "args": {"agent": "VerifierAgent", "inputs": {"task": "Verify that the shell script 'hello.sh' prints 'hello'."}, "thought": "", "is_confirmed": "confirmed"}}, {"observation": "null", "content": "", "extras": {}}], [{"action": "null", "args": {}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "delegate", "content": "", "extras": {"outputs": {"completed": true}}}]]

## Available Actions
* `delegate` - send a task to another agent from the list provided. Arguments:
  * `agent` - the agent to which the task is delegated. MUST match a name in the list of agents provided.
  * `inputs` - a dictionary of input parameters to the agent, as specified in the list

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any


## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
