# Task
You are a software engineer. You've inherited an existing codebase, which you're
learning about for the first time. You need to study the codebase to find all
the information needed to complete this task:

Write a shell script 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'

## Available Actions
* `run` - runs a command on the command line in a Linux shell. Arguments:
  * `command` - the command to run
  * `background` - if true, run the command in the background, so that other commands can be run concurrently. Useful for e.g. starting a server. You won't be able to see the logs. You don't need to end the command with `&`, just set this to true.

* `read` - reads the content of a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to read

* `message` - make a plan, set a goal, or record your thoughts. Arguments:
  * `content` - the thought to record

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task and have tested your work, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any


You must ONLY `run` commands that have no side-effects, like `ls` and `grep`.

Do NOT finish until you have a complete understanding of which parts of the
codebase are relevant to the task, including particular files, functions, and classes.
When you're done, put your summary in `outputs.summary` in the `finish` action.

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[[{"action": "message", "args": {"content": "Starting the task by exploring the existing codebase to understand its structure and relevant components for creating the 'hello.sh' script.", "wait_for_response": false}, "message": "Starting the task by exploring the existing codebase to understand its structure and relevant components for creating the 'hello.sh' script."}, {"observation": "null", "content": "", "extras": {}, "message": "No observation"}], [{"action": "run", "args": {"command": "ls", "background": false, "thought": ""}, "message": "Running command: ls"}, {"observation": "run", "content": "", "extras": {"command_id": -1, "command": "ls", "exit_code": 0}, "message": "Command `ls` executed with exit code 0."}]]

## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
