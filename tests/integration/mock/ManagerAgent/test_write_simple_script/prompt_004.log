# Task
You are a software engineer. You've inherited an existing codebase, which you
need to modify to complete this task:

Write a shell script 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'.



## Available Actions
* `run` - runs a command on the command line in a Linux shell. Arguments:
  * `command` - the command to run
  * `background` - if true, run the command in the background, so that other commands can be run concurrently. Useful for e.g. starting a server. You won't be able to see the logs. You don't need to end the command with `&`, just set this to true.

* `write` - writes the content to a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to write
  * `content` - the content to write to the file

* `read` - reads the content of a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to read

* `message` - make a plan, set a goal, record your thoughts, or ask for more input from the user. Arguments:
  * `content` - the thought to record
  * `wait_for_response` - set to `true` to wait for the user to respond before proceeding

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any


Do NOT finish until you have completed the tasks.

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[[{"source": "agent", "action": "write", "args": {"path": "hello.sh", "content": "#!/bin/bash\n\n# Print 'hello'\necho 'hello'", "start": 0, "end": -1, "thought": ""}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "write", "content": "", "extras": {"path": "hello.sh"}}], [{"source": "agent", "action": "run", "args": {"command": "chmod +x hello.sh", "background": false, "thought": ""}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "run", "content": "", "extras": {"command_id": -1, "command": "chmod +x hello.sh", "exit_code": 0}}]]

## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
