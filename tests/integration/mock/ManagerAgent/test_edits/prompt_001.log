# Task
You are in charge of accomplishing the following task:
Fix typos in bad.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.

In order to accomplish this goal, you must delegate tasks to one or more agents, who
can do the actual work. A description of each agent is provided below. You MUST
select one of the delegates below to move towards accomplishing the task, and you MUST
provide the correct inputs for the delegate you select.

Note: the delegated agent either returns "finish" or "reject".
- If the action is "finish", but the full task is not done yet, you should
continue to delegate to one of the agents below to until the full task is finished.
- If the action is "reject", it means the delegated agent is not capable of the
task you send to. You should revisit the input you send to the delegate, and consider
whether any other delegate would be able to solve the task. If you cannot find
a proper delegate agent, or the delegate attempts keep failing, call the `reject`
action. In `reason` attribute, make sure you include your attempts (e.g. what agent
you have delegated to, and why they failed).

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[[{"source": "user", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "Fix typos in bad.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.", "wait_for_response": false}}, {"observation": "null", "content": "", "extras": {}}]]

If the last item in the history is an error, you should try to fix it. If you
cannot fix it, call the `reject` action.

## Available Actions
* `delegate` - send a task to another agent from the list provided. Arguments:
  * `agent` - the agent to which the task is delegated. MUST match a name in the list of agents provided.
  * `inputs` - a dictionary of input parameters to the agent, as specified in the list

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any

* `reject` - reject the task. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary with only a `reason` attribute


## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
