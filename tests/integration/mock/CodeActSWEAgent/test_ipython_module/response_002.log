Now that `pymsgbox` is installed, let's import it and print its version to a file named `test.txt`:


```
pythonCopy code`<execute_ipython>
import pymsgbox

# Get the version of pymsgbox
pymsgbox_version = pymsgbox.__version__

# Write the version to a file
with open("/workspace/test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(pymsgbox_version)
</execute_ipython>`
```
This will import `pymsgbox`, retrieve its version, and then write the version to the `test.txt` file in the `/workspace` directory.
