Next, let's import `pymsgbox` and print its version to `/workspace/test.txt`.

<execute_ipython>
import pymsgbox

version = pymsgbox.__version__

with open("/workspace/test.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"pymsgbox version: {version}\n")

# Verify the content of the file
with open("/workspace/test.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

content
