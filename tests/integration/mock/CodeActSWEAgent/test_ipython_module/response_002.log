Next, let's import `pymsgbox`, print its version, and save the output to `/workspace/test.txt`.

<execute_ipython>
import pymsgbox

# Print the version of pymsgbox and save it to /workspace/test.txt
version_info = pymsgbox.__version__
with open("/workspace/test.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(f"pymsgbox version: {version_info}\n")

# Verify the content of the file
with open("/workspace/test.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
