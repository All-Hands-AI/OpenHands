Let's correct the typos in the `bad.txt` file.

1. "stupid typoo" should be "stupid typo".
2. "No mor typos!" should be "No more typos!".

I will make these changes now.

<execute_ipython>
edit_file_by_line('bad.txt', 1, 1, 'This is a stupid typo.')
edit_file_by_line('bad.txt', 3, 3, 'No more typos!')
