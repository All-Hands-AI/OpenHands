Thoughts:
To begin solving the task, I need to create a new shell script named 'hello.sh'. This script should contain a simple command to print 'hello'. I will use the `write` command to create this file and insert the necessary bash script code.

Action:
```
write hello.sh #!/bin/bash
echo 'hello'
```
