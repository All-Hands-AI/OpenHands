Thoughts:
Based on the previous actions, it appears that the file 'hello.sh' has been created but no content has been written into it yet. The task requires a shell script that prints 'hello'. I need to write the appropriate bash command into 'hello.sh' to fulfill this requirement. The command to print in bash is `echo "hello"`.

Action:
```
write hello.sh echo "hello"
```
