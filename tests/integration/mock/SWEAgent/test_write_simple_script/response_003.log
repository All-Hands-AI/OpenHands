Thoughts:
I have created the file 'hello.sh' but have not yet written the script content that prints "hello". The next step is to write the shell script code into 'hello.sh'. This will include a shebang line to specify the shell interpreter (bash in this case) and an echo command to print "hello".

Action:
```
write hello.sh #!/bin/bash
echo "hello"
```
