Thoughts:
From the previous actions, it appears that the file 'hello.sh' has been created but no content has been added to it yet. The task requires writing a shell script that prints 'hello'. I will now add the necessary bash command to the script to fulfill this requirement.

Action:
```
write hello.sh echo "hello"
```
