"Thoughts:\nFrom the previous actions, it appears that the file 'hello.sh' has been created but no content has been written into it yet. The task requires that this script should print 'hello' when executed. To achieve this, I need to write the bash command `echo \"hello\"` into 'hello.sh'. This will ensure that when the script is run, it outputs the word 'hello'.\n\nAction:\n```\nwrite hello.sh echo \"hello\"\n```"
