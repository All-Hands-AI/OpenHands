Thoughts:
It appears that the file 'hello.sh' has been created but still lacks any content. The task requires writing a shell script that prints 'hello'. I will now add the necessary bash command to the script to fulfill this requirement. This will involve using the `write` command to insert the bash script code that echoes 'hello'.

Action:
```
write hello.sh echo "hello"
```
