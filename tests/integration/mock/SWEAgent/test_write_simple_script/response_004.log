Thoughts:
Based on the previous actions, it seems that the file 'hello.sh' has been created but the content has not been verified yet. The task requires a shell script that prints 'hello'. I need to read the content of 'hello.sh' to ensure that the correct command `echo "hello"` has been written into it. If the content is correct, I can then proceed to test the script to confirm it behaves as expected.

Action:
```
read hello.sh
```
