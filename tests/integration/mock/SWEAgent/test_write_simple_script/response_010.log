Thoughts:
The shell script 'hello.sh' has been created to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. The script content is currently set to "echo 'hello'". The next step is to make sure that the script is executable and then test it to ensure that it prints 'hello' without asking for confirmation.

Action:
```
chmod +x hello.sh
```
