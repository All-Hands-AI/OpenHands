Thoughts:
I need to add the code to the 'hello.sh' script that will print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. Since the previous attempts to write the code using the 'write' command did not seem to save the changes, I will use the 'edit' command to add the necessary code to the 'hello.sh' script.

Action:
```
edit 0 0 "echo 'hello'"
```
