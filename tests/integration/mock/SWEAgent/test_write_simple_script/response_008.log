Thoughts:
Despite multiple attempts to write content into 'hello.sh', the file still appears to be empty. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the write command was used or possibly a misunderstanding in the feedback mechanism. To ensure that the file contains the necessary script, I will read the contents of 'hello.sh' to verify its current state. This will help determine if the previous write operations were successful or if there is indeed an issue with file writing.

Action:
```
read hello.sh
```
