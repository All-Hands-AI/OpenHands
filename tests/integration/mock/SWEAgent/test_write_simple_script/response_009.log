Thoughts:
I have attempted to add the code to the 'hello.sh' script using the 'write' command multiple times, but it seems that the changes have not been saved. I will use the 'edit' command to add the necessary code to the 'hello.sh' script. I need to add the echo command to the file to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation.

Action:
```
edit 0 0 echo "hello"
```
