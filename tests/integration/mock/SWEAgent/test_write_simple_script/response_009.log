Thoughts:
I need to ensure that the 'hello.sh' file contains the code to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. I will use the echo command to achieve this. Since I have already created the file, I should read the file to check its current content and then make changes if necessary.

Action:
```
read hello.sh
```
