Thoughts:
The content of 'hello.sh' has been successfully written and verified to contain the correct bash script to print 'hello'. Since the task was to write a shell script that prints 'hello' and this has been achieved, the next logical step is to conclude the task. I will use the `exit` command to indicate that the task is complete.

Action:
```
exit
```
