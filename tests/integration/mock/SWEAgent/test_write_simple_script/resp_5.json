"Thoughts:\nThe content of 'hello.sh' has been verified to contain the correct script to print \"hello\". The next logical step is to ensure that the script is executable and functions as intended. I will change the permissions of the file to make it executable using the `chmod` command. This will allow us to run the script and confirm its functionality.\n\nAction:\n```\nchmod +x hello.sh\n```"
