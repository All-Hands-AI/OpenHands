Thoughts:
Despite multiple attempts to write content into 'hello.sh', the file still appears to be empty. It seems there might have been an issue with the previous write commands not being executed correctly or not being saved. I will attempt once more to write the necessary bash command into 'hello.sh' to print 'hello'. This will involve using the `write` command to insert the correct bash script code into 'hello.sh'. If this does not work, I will need to investigate further potential issues with file writing or permissions.

Action:
```
write hello.sh "#!/bin/bash\necho 'hello'"
```
