Thoughts:
I need to add the code to the 'hello.sh' script that will print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. I have already attempted to do this a few times, but it seems that the changes have not been saved. I will use the 'edit' command to add the necessary code to the 'hello.sh' script.

Action:
```
edit 0 0 "echo 'hello'"
```
