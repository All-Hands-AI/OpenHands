Thoughts:
I need to add the command in the 'hello.sh' script to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. Since the script is already created, made executable, and the initial content was added, I should now insert the command to print 'hello' into the script.

Action:
I will edit the 'hello.sh' script to include the command to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation.
