Thoughts:
I have created the file 'hello.sh' but I have not yet written any content into it. The task requires me to write a shell script that prints 'hello'. I need to add the appropriate bash command to this file to fulfill the requirement. The command to print in bash is `echo`. I will write this command into 'hello.sh'.

Action:
```
write hello.sh echo "hello"
```
