Thoughts:
The task is to write a shell script named 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'. I have already created the file 'hello.sh' in a previous step. Now, I need to write the shell script code into this file. The script should include the shebang line to specify the shell interpreter and a command to print 'hello'.

Action:
```
write hello.sh #!/bin/bash
echo "hello"
```
