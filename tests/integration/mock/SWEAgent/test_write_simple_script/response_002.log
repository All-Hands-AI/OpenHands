Thoughts:
Since the file 'hello.sh' has been created, the next step is to write the shell script code that prints "hello". This involves adding a shebang line to specify the shell interpreter and a print command. I will add these lines to the 'hello.sh' file.

Action:
```
write hello.sh #!/bin/bash
echo "hello"
```
