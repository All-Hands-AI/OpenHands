Thoughts:
The shell script 'hello.sh' has been successfully created and tested, and it correctly prints 'hello' as required. The script includes the shebang line and the echo command to print 'hello'. Since the script is functioning as expected and meets the task requirements, there are no further modifications or tests needed. It's time to conclude this task.

Action:
```
exit
```
