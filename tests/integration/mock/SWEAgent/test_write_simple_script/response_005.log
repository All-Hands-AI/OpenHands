Thoughts:
Despite multiple attempts to write content into 'hello.sh', the file still appears to be empty. I need to ensure that the content is correctly written this time. The script should contain a simple bash command to print 'hello'. I will use the `write` command to insert the correct bash script code into 'hello.sh'.

Action:
```
write hello.sh echo "hello"
```
