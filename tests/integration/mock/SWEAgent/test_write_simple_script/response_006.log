Thoughts:
The shell script 'hello.sh' has been successfully created and tested, and it correctly prints "hello" when executed. Since the task was to write a shell script that prints 'hello' and this has been achieved as evidenced by the output from the previous run command, there are no further modifications or actions needed on the script. Therefore, I should conclude this task.

Action:
```
exit
```
