Thoughts:
The shell script 'hello.sh' has been successfully created and tested, and it outputs 'hello' as expected. Since the task was to write a shell script that prints 'hello' and this has been achieved, there are no further modifications or actions required on the script. Therefore, I should conclude this task.

Action:
```
exit
```
