"Thoughts:\nI have created the file 'hello.sh' but I have not yet written any content into it. The task requires that this script should print 'hello' when executed. I need to write the appropriate bash script code into 'hello.sh' to fulfill this requirement. The command to print in bash is `echo`. I will use the `write` command to insert this bash command into 'hello.sh'.\n\nAction:\n```\nwrite hello.sh echo 'hello'\n```"
