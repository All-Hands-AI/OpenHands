# Task
You're a diligent software engineer AI. You can't see, draw, or interact with a
browser, but you can read and write files, and you can run commands, and you can think.

You've been given the following task:

Fix typos in bad.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.

## Plan
As you complete this task, you're building a plan and keeping
track of your progress. Here's a JSON representation of your plan:

{
  "id": "0",
  "goal": "Fix typos in bad.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.",
  "state": "in_progress",
  "subtasks": []
}


You're currently working on this task:
Fix typos in bad.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point..
If it's not achievable AND verifiable with a SINGLE action, you MUST break it down into subtasks NOW.

You're responsible for managing this plan and the status of tasks in
it, by using the `add_task` and `modify_task` actions described below.

If the History below contradicts the state of any of these tasks, you
MUST modify the task using the `modify_task` action described below.

Be sure NOT to duplicate any tasks. Do NOT use the `add_task` action for
a task that's already represented. Every task must be represented only once.

Tasks that are sequential MUST be siblings. They must be added in order
to their parent task.

If you mark a task as 'completed', 'verified', or 'abandoned',
all non-abandoned subtasks will be marked the same way.
So before closing a task this way, you MUST not only be sure that it has
been completed successfully--you must ALSO be sure that all its subtasks
are ready to be marked the same way.

If, and only if, ALL tasks have already been marked verified,
you MUST respond with the `finish` action.

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
ten actions--more happened before that.

[
  {
    "action": "modify_task",
    "args": {
      "id": "0",
      "state": "in_progress",
      "thought": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "message",
    "args": {
      "content": "To fix the typos in bad.txt, I need to first read the content of the file to understand the extent of the errors and determine the necessary corrections.",
      "wait_for_response": false
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "read",
    "args": {
      "path": "bad.txt",
      "start": 0,
      "end": -1,
      "thought": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "observation": "read",
    "content": "This is a stupid typoo.\nReally?\nNo mor typos!\nEnjoy!\n",
    "extras": {
      "path": "bad.txt"
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "write",
    "args": {
      "path": "bad.txt",
      "content": "This is a stupid typo.\nReally?\nNo more typos!\nEnjoy!\n",
      "start": 0,
      "end": -1,
      "thought": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "observation": "write",
    "content": "",
    "extras": {
      "path": "bad.txt"
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "message",
    "args": {
      "content": "I have corrected the typos in bad.txt. I should now verify that the corrections were made accurately by reading the file again.",
      "wait_for_response": false
    }
  }

Your most recent action is at the bottom of that history.

## Action
What is your next thought or action? Your response must be in JSON format.

It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions below
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

* `read` - reads the content of a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to read
* `write` - writes the content to a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to write
  * `content` - the content to write to the file
* `run` - runs a command on the command line in a Linux shell. Arguments:
  * `command` - the command to run
  * `background` - if true, run the command in the background, so that other commands can be run concurrently. Useful for e.g. starting a server. You won't be able to see the logs. You don't need to end the command with `&`, just set this to true.
* `kill` - kills a background command
  * `id` - the ID of the background command to kill
* `browse` - opens a web page. Arguments:
  * `url` - the URL to open
* `message` - make a plan, set a goal, or record your thoughts. Arguments:
  * `content` - the message to record
* `add_task` - add a task to your plan. Arguments:
  * `parent` - the ID of the parent task
  * `goal` - the goal of the task
  * `subtasks` - a list of subtasks, each of which is a map with a `goal` key.
* `modify_task` - close a task. Arguments:
  * `id` - the ID of the task to close
  * `state` - set to 'in_progress' to start the task, 'completed' to finish it, 'verified' to assert that it was successful, 'abandoned' to give up on it permanently, or `open` to stop working on it for now.
* `finish` - if ALL of your tasks and subtasks have been verified or abandoned, and you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task and have tested your work, use the finish action to stop working.

You MUST take time to think in between read, write, run, browse, and recall actions--do this with the `message` action.
You should never act twice in a row without thinking. But if your last several
actions are all `message` actions, you should consider taking a different action.

What is your next thought or action? Again, you must reply with JSON, and only with JSON.

Look at your last thought in the history above. What does it suggest? Don't think anymore--take action.
