The task was to create a shell script named `hello.sh` that prints "hello" without asking for any confirmation. Based on the history:

1. The content of `hello.sh` was read and confirmed to contain:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo 'hello'
   ```
   This script correctly prints "hello" when executed.

2. The script was executed using the command `bash hello.sh`, and the output was "hello", which matches the expected output.

Since the script behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the task, the task is completed successfully.

```json
{
  "action": "finish",
  "args": {
    "outputs": {
      "completed": true
    }
  }
}
```
