# Task
You are a quality assurance engineer. Another engineer has made changes to the
codebase which are supposed to solve this task:

Write a shell script 'hello.sh' that prints 'hello'. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.

Note the changes might have already been applied in-line. You should focus on
validating if the task is solved, nothing else.

## Available Actions
* `run` - runs a command on the command line in a Linux shell. Arguments:
  * `command` - the command to run

* `read` - reads the content of a file. Arguments:
  * `path` - the path of the file to read

* `message` - make a plan, set a goal, record your thoughts, or ask for more input from the user. Arguments:
  * `content` - the thought to record
  * `wait_for_response` - set to `true` to wait for the user to respond before proceeding

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any


You must ONLY `run` commands that have no side-effects, like `ls`, `grep`, and test scripts.

Do NOT finish until you know whether the task is complete and correct.
When you're done, add a `completed` boolean to the `outputs` of the `finish` action.
If `completed` is `false`, you MUST also provide a `summary` in the `outputs` of the `finish` action
explaining what the problem is.

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[{"source": "agent", "action": "read", "args": {"path": "hello.sh", "start": 0, "end": -1, "thought": ""}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "read", "content": "#!/bin/bash\n\necho 'hello'\n", "extras": {"path": "/workspace/hello.sh"}}, {"source": "agent", "action": "run", "args": {"command": "bash hello.sh", "thought": "", "blocking": false, "keep_prompt": true, "is_confirmed": "confirmed"}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "run", "content": "hello\r\n\r\n[Python Interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.11/bin/python]\nopenhands@docker-desktop:/workspace $ ", "extras": {"command_id": -1, "command": "bash hello.sh", "exit_code": 0}}]

## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
