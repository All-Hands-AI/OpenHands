# Task
You are a responsible software engineer and always write good commit messages.

Please analyze the diff in the staging area, understand the context and content
of the updates from the diff only. Identify key elements like:
- Which files are affected?
- What types of changes were made (e.g., new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, testing)?

Then you should generate a commit message that succinctly summarizes the staged
changes. The commit message should include:
- A summary line that clearly states the purpose of the changes.
- Optionally, a detailed description if the changes are complex or need further explanation.

You should first use `git status` to check whether it's a valid git repo and there
is diff in the staging area. If not, please call the `reject` action.

If it is a valid git repo and there is diff in the staging area, you should find
the diff using `git diff --cached`, compile a commit message, and call the `finish`
action with `outputs.answer` set to the answer.

## History
Here is a recent history of actions you've taken in service of this plan,
as well as observations you've made. This only includes the MOST RECENT
actions and observations--more may have happened before that.
They are time-ordered, with your most recent action at the bottom.

[{"source": "agent", "action": "run", "args": {"command": "git status", "thought": "", "blocking": false, "keep_prompt": true, "is_confirmed": "confirmed"}}, {"source": "agent", "observation": "run", "content": "fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)\r\nStopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).\r\n\r\n[Python Interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.11/bin/python]\nopenhands@docker-desktop:/workspace $ ", "extras": {"command_id": -1, "command": "git status", "exit_code": 128}}]

If the last item in the history is an error, you should try to fix it.

## Available Actions
* `run` - runs a command on the command line in a Linux shell. Arguments:
  * `command` - the command to run

* `reject` - reject the task. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary with only a `reason` attribute

* `finish` - if you're absolutely certain that you've completed your task, use the finish action to stop working. Arguments:
  * `outputs` - a dictionary representing the outputs of your task, if any


## Format
Your response MUST be in JSON format. It must be an object, and it must contain two fields:
* `action`, which is one of the actions specified here
* `args`, which is a map of key-value pairs, specifying the arguments for that action

You MUST NOT include any other text besides the JSON response
