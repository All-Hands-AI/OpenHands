Thank you for the reminder. Since we can't use git commands directly, I'll compose a git commit message based on the file we just created. This message would be appropriate if we were able to stage and commit the file:

<execute_bash>
echo "Add sample.txt with introductory content

- Created a new file 'sample.txt'
- Added a single line of text to demonstrate file creation
- This commit serves as an initial setup for the project"
