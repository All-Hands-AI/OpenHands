I have created a commit message for the hypothetical scenario of adding a new file called 'sample.txt' to a project. The commit message follows good practices by including:

1. A concise summary line (feat: Add sample text file)
2. A blank line separating the summary from the body
3. A detailed description of the changes
4. Bullet points listing the specific modifications

This commit message is now saved in the file 'commit_message.txt' in the current directory. In a real git repository, you would use this message when committing the changes.

<finish></finish>
