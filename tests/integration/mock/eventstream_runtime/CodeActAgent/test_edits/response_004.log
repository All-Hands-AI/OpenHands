Great! The typos in the bad.txt file have been successfully fixed. Let's review the changes:

1. "typoo" has been corrected to "typo"
2. "mor" has been corrected to "more"

All other content remains unchanged. The file now contains the correct text without any typos.

Since the task of fixing typos in bad.txt has been completed, I'll conclude the task.
