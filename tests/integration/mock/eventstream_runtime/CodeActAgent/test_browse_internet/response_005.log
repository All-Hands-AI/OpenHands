Thank you for providing the content from localhost:8000. Based on the information retrieved, I can now answer your question about the ultimate answer to life.

The ultimate answer to life, according to the content on localhost:8000, is:

"OpenDevin is all you need!"

This appears to be a playful reference to the popular science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, where the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is famously "42". In this case, it's been adapted to promote OpenDevin as the ultimate solution.

Since I've successfully retrieved and reported the answer from the specified localhost, I believe I've completed the task you've given me.
