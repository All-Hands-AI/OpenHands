I understand now that we are in an empty workspace and there is no git repository initialized. Since there's no existing repository or staged changes, we can't write a commit message at this point.

To complete this task, we would need to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Create some files or make changes
3. Stage those changes
4. Then write a commit message

However, since the task specifically asked to write a commit message for the current staging area (which doesn't exist), and not to ask for confirmation, I'll conclude that the task cannot be completed as requested.
