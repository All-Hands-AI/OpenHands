I understand now that we are in an empty workspace and there is no git repository initialized. Since there's no git repository and no changes to commit, we can't write a git commit message.

To complete this task, we would need to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Create some files or make changes
3. Stage those changes
4. Write a commit message

However, since we don't have any specific task or changes to commit, I'll conclude this task.
