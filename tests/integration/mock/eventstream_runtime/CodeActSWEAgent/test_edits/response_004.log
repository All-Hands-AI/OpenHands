Great! All the typos in the file have been fixed. The task is now complete. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Changed "typoo" to "typo" in the first line.
2. Changed "mor" to "more" in the third line.

The file now reads correctly without any typos. Since the task is finished, I'll end my response with the finish tag.

<finish></finish>
