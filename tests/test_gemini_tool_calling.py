If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 120 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n",

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n",

The FDV value is theoretical as increasing the circulating supply of a coin may impact its market price. Also depending on the tokenomics, emission schedule or lock-up period of a coin's supply, it may take a significant time before its entire supply is released into circulation.\n\nLearn more about FDV here.\n\t$432,804,757,184\n24 Hour Trading Vol\nA measure of a cryptocurrency trading volume across all tracked platforms in the last 24 hours.

As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges to crypto lending and borrowing platforms and more.\n\nEthereum is also home to numerous Layer 2 solutions that offer users a cheaper and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions include Arbitrum, which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum, and Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs parallel to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat Makes Ethereum Unique?\n\nEthereum allows for the creation of ERC-20 tokens, which can be used as native tokens for the applications that live on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens can be used for governance on their respective applications, for utility purposes such as paying trading fees, or as stores of value, as in the case of stablecoins like USDT and USDC. However, gas fees for transactions are still paid in ETH, as transactions are still recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHistory of Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum project was initially conceived when Vitalik Buterin published the whitepaper in 2013. The yellowpaper, which consists of more technical details on how Ethereum would work, was later published by Gavin Wood in 2014. A fundraising sale was conducted in September 2014 and the network went live in July 2015. On 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus with the Merge.\n\nWhat’s Next for Ethereum?\n\nNow that the Merge is over, the final stage of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, where the database on the Ethereum blockchain is split into 64 shard chains. With sharding, each validator only needs to verify the respective shards they’re responsible for, instead of verifying the entire network. This will also lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wishes to run a node. Besides encouraging further decentralization, this will improve scalability and ideally reduce the gas fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat can Ether (ETH) be Used For?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native coin that powers the Ethereum network and is used to pay for transactions. ETH functions as a utility token and is used to pay for gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, denominated in gwei. Stakers on the Ethereum network earn ETH as their reward for securing the network. ETH is also a cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin, and can be traded on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, or even deposited as collateral to take out loans.\n\nTo learn more about Ethereum, please check out the following articles:\n\nRead this detailed guide on Ethereum Upgrades, the Merge, and ETH 2.0\nLearn how to stake ETH\n\nBuilding on Ethereum?

Institutional demand rises – ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries drive ...\n[5] Detail Information: Learn\nTopics\nCMC Updates\nGlossary\nAuthors\nEthereum News: Why is ETH’s price up today?\nTable of Contents\nCMC Crypto News\nEthereum News: Why is ETH’s price up today?\nBy CoinMarketCap\n2m\nCreated 1d ago, last updated 1d ago\n\nGet the latest Ethereum prices, real-time exchange rates, market trends, and price predictions. Track ETH to USD and stay updated with live crypto data.\n\nTable of Contents\nEthereum News: 16/07/2025\n1. Primary catalyst: ETH/BTC breakout momentum\n2. Supporting factors: Institutional flows\n3. Technical context: Overheated but bullish\nWhat is the latest news on ETH?\n1. Market Metrics\n2. Business & Partnerships\n3. Regulatory & External Factors\nEthereum News: 16/07/2025\n\nEthereum’s 6.4% 24-hour surge reflects bullish technicals, altcoin rotation signals, and growing institutional adoption.\n\nETH/BTC nears key resistance – a breakout could trigger altcoin season.\nInstitutional demand rises – ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries drive inflows.\nTechnical overextension risks – RSI7 at 88 signals short-term overheating.\n1. Primary catalyst: ETH/BTC breakout momentum\nEthereum is testing the 0.065–0.075 BTC resistance zone – the same level that ignited the 2021 altcoin rally. A decisive breach here would confirm capital rotation from Bitcoin to ETH, as noted by analyst Crypflow. The ETH/BTC pair’s 3.5% gain in 24 hours aligns with Bitcoin’s dominance dropping from 63.65% to 62.88% – the steepest single-day decline in two weeks.\n2. Supporting factors: Institutional flows\nETH ETF momentum: Ethereum spot ETFs saw $204.9M inflows this week despite $205M+ in ETH exiting exchanges, suggesting OTC accumulation by institutions (CoinMarketCap).\nCorporate adoption: SharpLink Gaming’s $463M ETH treasury purchase (July 10) and similar moves by public companies signal long-term confidence.\n3. Technical context: Overheated but bullish\nRSI7 at 88.22 – most overbought since May 2025, historically followed by 5-10% corrections.\nMACD divergence: Histogram at +56.3 shows bullish momentum, though narrowing since July 9.\nCritical Fibonacci level at $3,142.43 (swing high) now acts as support after being reclaimed.\n\nEthereum’s surge combines technical momentum with structural shifts toward altcoins and institutional adoption. While overbought signals suggest potential consolidation, the ETH/BTC breakout attempt could sustain upward pressure.\n\nWill Ethereum’s dominance hold if Bitcoin reclaims its 24-hour market share losses?\n\nWhat is the latest news on ETH?\n\nEthereum shows bullish momentum with rising dominance and technical indicators pointing to potential altcoin season, but faces headwinds from security breaches and regulatory scrutiny of crosschain crime.\n\nETH dominance hits 10% — highest since 2020\nETH/BTC ratio nears critical breakout mirroring 2021 altseason setup\n$27M BigONE hack impacts ETH liquidity\n1. Market Metrics\nEthereum dominance reached 10.2% on July 15, its highest since March 2020. This aligns with:\n- ETH/BTC ratio testing 0.065-0.075 resistance zone\n- Monthly Stochastic RSI bullish crossover (last seen before 2021 altseason)\n- Institutional accumulation: BlackRock bought 60,674 ETH ($158.6M) on July 10\n2. Business & Partnerships\nPeter Thiel’s Founders Fund acquired a 9.1% stake in BitMine (July 14), backing its pivot to an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy mirroring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin approach. BitMine shares surged 15.47% post-announcement (CoinMarketCap).\n3. Regulatory & External Factors\nCrosschain laundering via Ethereum surged 211% since 2023, with $21.8B in illicit flows\nBigONE exchange hack drained 350 ETH ($1.1M) on July 16 through compromised servers\nEthereum’s technical strength and institutional adoption contrast with escalating security risks in DeFi infrastructure. Will ETH’s dominance sustain if crosschain crime triggers stricter regulations?\n\nCheck out our Ethereum page for more info.\n\nCMC AI can make mistakes, please DYOR.

Follow Coingape for all tre\n[... Observation truncated due to length ...]\nhese figures highlight a consistent weakening of Ethereum’s value when benchmarked against Bitcoin, despite intermittent short-term recoveries.\n\nThe recent bottom formed in mid-2025 saw ETH/BTC near the 0.022 zone. Since then, the ratio has bounced slightly, hinting at possible rotation back into ETH. However, the recovery remains shallow and far from reclaiming previous levels seen in late 2021.\n\nThe consistent downtrend in the ETH/BTC valuation raises questions about Ethereum’s role as the dominant altcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio has long served as a metric of Ethereum’s relative strength and influence in the broader crypto ecosystem. A persistent decline may reflect structural shifts, including Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, regulatory scrutiny, and Bitcoin’s dominance in institutional portfolios.\n\nAs capital flows favor Bitcoin’s perceived stability, ETH’s share weakens despite advancements in smart contracts and Layer 2 scaling. Even as ETH/BTC bounces near 0.0283, the broader market shows caution. Traders await confirmation of trend reversal before committing to altcoin-heavy strategies. Until then, ETH’s relative performance may remain limited compared to Bitcoin.\n\nCurrent conditions suggest a reacceleration in Bitcoin dominance. This aligns with the ETH/BTC downturn that intensified throughout 2023 and 2024. Short-term bounces have not reversed the macro trend. The drop to 0.0283, paired with low confidence among ETH holders, mirrors previous cycle lows. Each cycle historically reflects rotation between BTC and ETH. In this phase, the market favors Bitcoin’s profile as a risk-adjusted hedge.\n\nInto The Cryptoverse data present a clear picture of Ethereum’s position. Although the ETH/BTC chart may recover, it currently reflects growing Bitcoin preference among long-term holders. The data also show a 9-year increase of 73.52% and a maximum lifetime gain of 453.12%, underscoring Ethereum’s historical relevance. However, the recent trend suggests that strength may now lie elsewhere in the market. Whether Ethereum can reassert leadership remains uncertain.\n\nComments\n\n﻿\n\n\nAdd a public comment...\nPost\n\nNo comments yet\n\nDisclaimer: The news articles available on this platform are generated in whole or in part by artificial intelligence and may not have been reviewed or fact checked by human editors.

Please conduct your own research before taking any action based on the content.\n\nEthereum is on the move, rallying another 9% in the past 24 hours. The rally has been driven by one of crypto’s larger players investing big money in ETH – giving bulls another reason to get excited.\n\nPrice is already pushing past key resistance levels, and talk of a new all-time high this cycle is picking up.\n\nMeanwhile, new meme coins like TOKEN6900 are starting to benefit from the momentum, seeing increased demand as traders seek Ethereum-linked tokens that could be about to explode.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps After World Liberty Financial’s $10M Investment\n\nEthereum has been on a roll the past few days, and a big reason is some massive buying behind the scenes.\n\nAccording to blockchain data from Nansen, World Liberty Financial just snapped up 3,007 ETH overnight – roughly $10 million at an average price of $3,325 per token.\n\nThis isn’t their first buy either. They secured an additional 4,468 ETH in March. That kind of accumulation isn’t something retail traders can pull off – and it’s a clear sign that institutions are betting on ETH to keep rising higher.\n\n🚨 Trump-backed World Liberty Financial just bought $10M in $ETH, per @nansen_ai.$ETH price: $3,341\n\nSmart money is buying while retail sleeps.\n\nThey’re not chasing pumps, they’re positioning early.#Ethereum #ETH pic.twitter.com/RZrrg5QMFQ\n\n— RK Gupta (EarnWithRK) (@earnwithrk) July 17, 2025\n\nETH’s price has reacted positively. The token is now hovering around $3,450, up 9% in the past day and 23% over the week.\n\nThat’s its highest point since mid-January. Open interest is back above $22.7 billion, so there’s plenty of leveraged money in the mix, too.\n\nAnd retail sentiment looks just as upbeat, with 81% of users on CoinMarketCap clicking the “Bullish” button right now.\n\nCan Ethereum Keep Rising and Hit a New All-Time High?\n\nWith ETH back above $3,400, the big question traders are asking: is this the run that takes it to new highs?\n\nETH’s previous all-time high was $4,891, which no longer seems out of reach. And a strong lineup of catalysts suggests that reaching this milestone again feels more attainable than ever.\n\nFirst off, Ethereum has reclaimed the key $3,000 resistance level. Breaking resistance typically leads to even larger price moves when it is retested and held.\n\n\nAt the same time, spot ETH ETFs are bringing in huge amounts of capital, including a record $726 million net inflow just last week.\n\nThere’s also the simple supply squeeze aspect: more ETH is staked, burned, and locked up than ever, while whale wallets keep adding.\n\nUltimately, if ETH holds above $3,000 through August and those ETF inflows stay strong, some well-known names – including Arthur Hayes – predict ETH could reach $5,000 before the end of the year.\n\nThat would not only clear 2021’s all-time high but also set the tone for whatever comes next.\n\nHow ETH’s Rally Could Boost New Meme Coins Like TOKEN6900\n\nWhile ETH is climbing, meme coin traders are already looking at where the spillover could land. One name showing up more and more is TOKEN6900.\n\nIt’s an Ethereum-based meme coin that doesn’t pretend to be anything else. The supply is exactly 930,993,091 tokens – just one more than SPX6900, as part of an ongoing inside joke.\n\nAnd the vibe is full degen. Retro Windows 95-style website, zero roadmap, and a tagline that literally says “nothing but vibes.”\n\nYet that attitude is resonating. T6900’s presale has already raised over $620,000 in early funding, with one whale investing over $11,000 this week.\n\n\n\nT6900 is showing up in several “best meme coin” lists, it’s trending on CoinSniper, and has been featured in videos from the team at 99Bitcoins.\n\nBasically, it’s got that same kind of SPX6900 setup – low-cap ERC-20 energy right before a wider meme coin season hits.\n\nAnd with ETH showing no signs of pulling back, the flow of capital into new meme plays is only set to get stronger.\n\nA higher ETH price means presale buyers have more firepower. Plus, now that Pectra is live and Layer-2 fees have dropped, tokens like T6900 have a more affordable path to DEX listings and swaps.\n\nSo, if ETH does break to a new all-time high this cycle, don’t be surprised if TOKEN6900 explodes too.\n\nVisit TOKEN6900 Presale\n\nDisclaimer: This media platform provides the content of this article on an \"as-is\" basis, without any warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied.
