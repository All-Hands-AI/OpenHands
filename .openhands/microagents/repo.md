This repository contains the code for OpenHands, an automated AI software engineer. It has a Python backend
(in the `openhands` directory) and React frontend (in the `frontend` directory).

## General Setup:
To set up the entire repo, including frontend and backend, run `make build`.
You don't need to do this unless the user asks you to, or if you're trying to run the entire application.

IMPORTANT: Before making any changes to the codebase, ALWAYS run `make install-pre-commit-hooks` to ensure pre-commit hooks are properly installed.

Before pushing any changes, you MUST ensure that any lint errors or simple test errors have been fixed.

* If you've made changes to the backend, you should run `pre-commit run --all-files --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml`
* If you've made changes to the frontend, you should run `cd frontend && npm run lint:fix && npm run build ; cd ..`

The pre-commit hooks MUST pass successfully before pushing any changes to the repository. This is a mandatory requirement to maintain code quality and consistency.

If either command fails, it may have automatically fixed some issues. You should fix any issues that weren't automatically fixed,
then re-run the command to ensure it passes. Common issues include:
- Mypy type errors
- Ruff formatting issues
- Trailing whitespace
- Missing newlines at end of files

## Repository Structure
Backend:
- Located in the `openhands` directory
- Testing:
  - All tests are in `tests/unit/test_*.py`
  - To test new code, run `poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_xxx.py` where `xxx` is the appropriate file for the current functionality
  - Write all tests with pytest

Frontend:
- Located in the `frontend` directory
- Prerequisites: A recent version of NodeJS / NPM
- Setup: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
- Testing:
  - Run tests: `npm run test`
  - To run specific tests: `npm run test -- -t "TestName"`
  - Our test framework is vitest
- Building:
  - Build for production: `npm run build`
- Environment Variables:
  - Set in `frontend/.env` or as environment variables
  - Available variables: VITE_BACKEND_HOST, VITE_USE_TLS, VITE_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY, VITE_FRONTEND_PORT
- Internationalization:
  - Generate i18n declaration file: `npm run make-i18n`

## Implementation Details

These details may or may not be useful for your current task.

### Frontend

#### Action Handling:
- Actions are defined in `frontend/src/types/action-type.ts`
- The `HANDLED_ACTIONS` array in `frontend/src/state/chat-slice.ts` determines which actions are displayed as collapsible UI elements
- To add a new action type to the UI:
  1. Add the action type to the `HANDLED_ACTIONS` array
  2. Implement the action handling in `addAssistantAction` function in chat-slice.ts
  3. Add a translation key in the format `ACTION_MESSAGE$ACTION_NAME` to the i18n files
- Actions with `thought` property are displayed in the UI based on their action type:
  - Regular actions (like "run", "edit") display the thought as a separate message
  - Special actions (like "think") are displayed as collapsible elements only
