# Task List

1. ✅ Checkout PR 10432 branch and read PR description to understand scope

2. ✅ Reproduce and validate the failing path with AgentFinishAction and tool metadata
Targeted unit test passes; JSON serialization path is safe with Thought normalization in event_to_dict and JSON encoder
3. 🔄 Centralize Thought coercion in Action.__post_init__ and remove per-class misplacements
Added Action.__post_init__ to normalize thought. Reverted accidental per-class insertions. Verified a couple of tests
4. ✅ Run targeted tests: conversation memory and event stream serialization

5. ⏳ Run pre-commit hooks and fix any issues

6. ⏳ Commit with correct authorship and co-author, push to feature branch

7. 🔄 Investigate the user's runtime error and confirm fix path
The error Object of type Thought is not JSON serializable occurs when EventStream.add_event attempts json.dumps(data) on an action before event_to_dict normalization. Our encoder and event_to_dict now normalize Thought; ensure runtime uses openhands.io.json.dumps, which it does. Likely old install or per-class misplacement caused before; confirm by recreating scenario in runtime.base.maybe_run_setup_script path
