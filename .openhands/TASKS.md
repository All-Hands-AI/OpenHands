# Task List

1. âœ… Checkout PR 10432 branch and read PR description to understand scope

2. âœ… Reproduce and validate the failing path with AgentFinishAction and tool metadata
Targeted unit test passes; JSON serialization path is safe with Thought normalization in event_to_dict and JSON encoder
3. âœ… Centralize Thought coercion in Action.__post_init__ and remove per-class misplacements
Implemented Action.__post_init__ normalization. Reverted accidental edits by restoring files. Verified key tests pass.
4. âœ… Run targeted tests: conversation memory and event stream serialization

5. âœ… Run pre-commit hooks and fix any issues

6. âœ… Commit with correct authorship and co-author, push to feature branch

7. ðŸ”„ Investigate the user's runtime error and confirm fix path
The original stack shows events/stream json.dumps(data) failing on Thought. Our event_to_dict now flattens Thought; encoder handles dataclasses. Also Action.__post_init__ ensures actions constructed anywhere have Thought. This should resolve the error. Recommend pulling latest and retrying. If error persists locally, check that odie environment imports repo code rather than an installed different openhands path, and ensure .venv is picking this branch.
