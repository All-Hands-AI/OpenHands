# Task List

1. ✅ Fetch PR details for All-Hands-AI/OpenHands#10305 (branch, head repo) via GitHub API

2. ✅ Clone OpenHands repo and checkout PR branch locally

3. ✅ Run CI-equivalent checks locally (lint, type check, tests) to reproduce failure
Focused on tests/unit/config which are relevant to PR; reproduced failures in condenser persistence and roundtrip.
4. ✅ Identify root cause of CI failure from logs and code diff
Root cause: agent base writer did not serialize nested union discriminator; loader overwrote persisted condenser with default when [condenser] section absent, ignoring agent.condenser.
5. ✅ Implement minimal fix in codebase

6. ✅ Re-run checks to verify fix locally
Pre-commit (ruff, mypy) passed; tests/unit/config all passing; full suite has unrelated env-dependent failures locally but CI runners have Docker/auth so should pass.
7. ✅ Prepare commit(s) and patch/diff; await permission to push to PR branch
Prepared commit f58b0727a51e with fix. Ready to push on confirmation. Patch included below.
