# Azure DevOps Integration Test Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive testing of the Azure DevOps integration implemented in this PR using a live Azure DevOps organization (`all-hands-ai`) and the `test-project` repository.

## Test Environment
- **Organization**: `all-hands-ai` 
- **Organization URL**: `https://dev.azure.com/all-hands-ai`
- **Test Repository**: `test-project/test-project`
- **Token Type**: Personal Access Token (organization-scoped)

## Components Tested

### 1. Token Validation (`openhands/integrations/utils.py`)
✅ **PASSED** - Token validation correctly identifies Azure DevOps tokens
- Successfully validates organization-scoped PAT tokens
- Correctly passes `organization_url` parameter to Azure DevOps service
- Properly handles authentication failures for GitHub/GitLab before trying Azure DevOps

### 2. Azure DevOps Service Implementation (`openhands/integrations/azure_devops/azure_devops_service.py`)

#### Authentication & User Management
✅ **PASSED** - User authentication and profile retrieval
- Successfully authenticates with organization-scoped tokens
- Retrieves user information via connection data API
- Gracefully falls back to basic user info when profile API is restricted

#### Repository Operations
✅ **PASSED** - Repository listing and management
- **`get_repositories()`**: Successfully retrieves all repositories (3 found)
  - `All Hands Default Project/All Hands Default Project`
  - `test-project/test-project` 
  - `All Hands Default Project/test-repo`
- **`search_repositories()`**: Successfully filters repositories by search query
- **`get_repository_details_from_repo_name()`**: Successfully retrieves specific repository details

#### Branch Operations  
✅ **PASSED** - Branch listing and management
- **`get_branches()`**: Successfully retrieves branch information
- Correctly handles repositories with no branches (empty repositories)
- Properly formats branch names by removing `refs/heads/` prefix

#### Work Item Operations
✅ **PASSED** - Work item querying and management
- **WIQL Queries**: Successfully executes Work Item Query Language queries
- **Work Item Details**: Successfully retrieves detailed work item information
- **Work Item Creation**: Successfully creates new work items
- **Work Item Updates**: Successfully updates work item states and fields
- Found and processed existing work item: "Test Issue - OpenHands Azure DevOps Integration Test"

#### Pull Request Operations
✅ **PASSED** - Pull request management
- Successfully queries active pull requests across repositories
- Correctly handles repositories with no active pull requests
- Properly formats pull request information

#### Suggested Tasks
✅ **PASSED** - Task suggestion functionality
- **`get_suggested_tasks()`**: Successfully identifies actionable items
- Found 1 suggested task (open issue) in the test environment
- Correctly categorizes tasks by type (OPEN_ISSUE, MERGE_CONFLICTS, etc.)

### 3. API Endpoints Tested

#### Core APIs
- ✅ **Projects API**: `/_apis/projects` - Successfully lists projects
- ✅ **Connection Data API**: `/_apis/connectionData` - Successfully retrieves user info
- ✅ **Repositories API**: `/_apis/git/repositories` - Successfully lists repositories
- ✅ **Refs API**: `/_apis/git/repositories/{id}/refs` - Successfully lists branches
- ✅ **Pull Requests API**: `/_apis/git/repositories/{id}/pullrequests` - Successfully lists PRs

#### Work Item APIs
- ✅ **WIQL API**: `/_apis/wit/wiql` - Successfully executes queries
- ✅ **Work Item Details API**: `/_apis/wit/workitems/{id}` - Successfully retrieves details
- ✅ **Work Item Creation API**: `/_apis/wit/workitems/$Task` - Successfully creates work items
- ✅ **Work Item Update API**: `/_apis/wit/workitems/{id}` - Successfully updates work items

### 4. Frontend Improvements

#### UX Enhancements
✅ **COMPLETED** - Improved user experience
- **Placeholder Text**: Updated organization URL placeholder to `https://dev.azure.com/{your-org-name}` for clarity
- **Instruction Text**: Removed redundant text "Enter just the token value. Both token and organization URL are required."
- **Multi-language Support**: Updated all language translations to remove redundant instruction text

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/features/settings/git-settings/azure-devops-token-input.tsx`
- `frontend/src/i18n/translation.json`
- `frontend/public/locales/en/translation.json`
