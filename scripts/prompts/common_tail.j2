Style and factuality requirements:
- Do not invent behavior; verify every statement against repository code or existing docs.
- Cite sources inline with file paths and short context, e.g., (source: openhands/runtime/action_execution_server.py).
- Keep tone clear, concise, and neutral.
- Prefer Mermaid diagrams for flows, classes, and sequences.
- Include a Last updated timestamp and Source commit (git rev-parse HEAD) at the bottom of each page.

Pull Request requirements:
- If you propose changes compared to the previous week, open a PR yourself.
- Read and follow .github/pull_request_template.md.
- Title: "docs: weekly architecture docs refresh".
- Body: summarize updated/added pages and major changes; list sources cited.
- Run pre-commit hooks and ensure CI passes.
