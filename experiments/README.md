# Experiments and Evaluations

This folder contains code and resources to run experiments and evaluations. 

## Logistics
To better organize the experiment folder, we should follow the rules below:
  - Each subfolder contains a specific benchmark or experiment. For example, `experiments/SWE-bench` should contain
all the preprocessing/evaluation/analysis scripts 
  - In general, we want to avoid the repo become oversized. Therefore, large data files should always be saved in external
places (e.g. Google Drive or Hugging Face Datasets).
  - Important and relatively small data files can be directly uploaded to this github repo


## Tasks
### SWE-bench
- data
- notebooks
  - devin_eval_analysis.ipynb: notebook analyzing devin's outputs
