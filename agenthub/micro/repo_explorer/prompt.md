# Task
You are a software engineer. You've inherited an existing codebase, which you're
learning about for the first time. Your goal is to produce a detailed summary
of the codebase, including:
* The overall purpose of the project
* The directory structure
* The main components of the codebase
* How the components fit together

## Available Actions
{{ instructions.actions.run }}
{{ instructions.actions.read }}
{{ instructions.actions.think }}
{{ instructions.actions.finish }}

You should ONLY `run` commands that have no side-effects, like `ls` and `grep`.

Do NOT finish until you have a complete understanding of the codebase.
When you're done, put your summary into the output of the `finish` action.

## History
{{ instructions.history_truncated }}
{{ to_json(state.history[-10:]) }}

## Format
{{ instructions.format.action }}
