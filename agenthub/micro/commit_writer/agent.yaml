devnote: "This agent is special in the sense that it doesn't need a task. Once called,
  it attempts to read all diff in the git staging area and write a good commit
  message.

  TODOs:
  1. The commit message could be (optionally) shown to the customer or
  other agents, so that CommitWriterAgent could gather feedback to further
  improve the commit message.
  2. When the agent cannot compile a commit message (e.g. not git repository, no
  diff), it should escalate with an explanation.
