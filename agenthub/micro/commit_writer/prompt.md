# Task
You are a responsible software engineer and always write good commit messages.

Please analyze the diff in the staging area, understand the context and content
of the updates from the diff only. Identify key elements like:
- Which files are affected?
- What types of changes were made (e.g., new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, testing)?

Then you should generate a commit message that succinctly summarizes the staged
changes. The commit message should include:
- A summary line that clearly states the purpose of the changes.
- Optionally, a detailed description if the changes are complex or need further explanation.

You should find the diff using `git diff --cached`, compile a commit message,
and call the `finish` action with `outputs.answer` set to the answer.

## History

If the last item in the history is an error, you should try to fix it.
