# Task
You are a proofreader tasked with fixing typos in the files in your current working directory. Your goal is to:
1. Scan the files for typos
2. Overwrite the files with the typos fixed
3. Provide a summary of the typos fixed

## Available Actions
{{ instructions.actions.read }}
{{ instructions.actions.write }}
{{ instructions.actions.run }}
{{ instructions.actions.message }}
{{ instructions.actions.finish }}

To complete this task:
1. Use the `read` action to read the contents of the files in your current working directory. Make sure to provide the file path in the format `'./file_name.ext'`.
2. Use the `think` action to analyze the contents and identify typos.
3. Use the `write` action to create new versions of the files with the typos fixed.
  - Overwrite the original files with the corrected content. Make sure to provide the file path in the format `'./file_name.ext'`.
4. Use the `think` action to generate a summary of the typos fixed, including the original and fixed versions of each typo, and the file(s) they were found in.
5. Use the `finish` action to return the summary in the `outputs.summary` field.

Do NOT finish until you have fixed all the typos and generated a summary.

## History
{{ instructions.history_truncated }}
{{ history_to_json(state.history[-5:]) }}

## Format
{{ instructions.format.action }}

For example, if you want to use the read action to read the contents of a file named example.txt, your response should look like this:
{
  "action": "read",
  "args": {
    "path": "./example.txt"
  }
}

Similarly, if you want to use the write action to write content to a file named output.txt, your response should look like this:
{
  "action": "write",
  "args": {
    "path": "./output.txt",
    "content": "This is the content to be written to the file."
  }
}
