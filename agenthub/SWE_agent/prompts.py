DOCUMENTATION = f"""DOCUMENTATION:
It is recommend that you use the commands provided for interacting with files and your directory because they have been specially built for you.
They will make it much easier for you to look at files and make changes. Using these commands will help you be better at your task.
You can open an file by using either the read or write operations.
- If a file already exists you should read it before making any changes. Use the `edit` command to make changes once you have read it.
- If you are creating a new file use the write command. Use the `edit` command to make changes once you have created the new file.

Commands:
{DEFAULT_COMMANDS}
{CUSTOM_COMMANDS}

The following commands require an open file to be used: edit, scroll_up, scroll_down, goto
To modify the current file use 'edit'. To move through the current file use 'goto' or 'scroll_up'/'scroll_down'
when using write and edit do not surround the code with any "" just write the code.
"""

GENERAL_GUIDELINES = '''INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. You can use any bash commands or custom commands you wish to complete your task. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can indicate that you are done by running the exit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim, node) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.

NOTE ABOUT THE write COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Reproduce the bug: Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issue discusses. If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment and run it to ensure you can reproduce the bug. Then, start trying to fix it. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the issue has indeed been resolved.
   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file, so that you can be sure the script ran fine all the way through.
2. Try different commands: If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it.
3. Navigate large files: If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, you would use the 'read' command like this: 'read <file> 583'. This is a much faster way to read through the file.
4. Handle input files: If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as 'buggy-input.png', and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repository code to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: 'search_dir "buggy-input.png"'. If that doesn't work, use the Linux 'find' command.
5. Understand your context: Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory. The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory.
6. Verify your edits: When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.
7. Thoroughly test your solution: After making any changes to fix a bug, be sure to thoroughly test your solution to ensure the bug has been resolved. Re-run the bug reproduction script and verify that the issue has been addressed.

RESPONSE_FORMAT = '''RESPONSE FORMAT:
This is the format of the response you will make in order to solve the current issue.
You will be given multiple iterations to complete this task so break it into steps and solve them one by one.

Your output must contain the following:
- First, thoughts about what your next action should be and plan it out.
    - You will have a memory of your thoughts so you can use this to remember things for the next step.
    - Use your thoughts to think about what you are currently doing, what you have done on prior steps and how that relates to solving the problem.
- Second, create a piece of code that will execute your next action based on the thoughts you have.
    - Remember that you can only have one action for each thought, do not include multiple actions.

Your code MUST be surrounded in triple back ticks EXACTLY like this:
```
<code>
```

Notes:
- Adhere to the format so that the program loop continues smoothly, it is very important to only give one command per output.
- DO NOT give more than one command within the triple backticks. This will just throw an error and nothing will happen as a result.
- Do not give multiple code blocks, if you do only the second one will be captured and run, this might give an error if the first one was necessary.
- To execute multiple commands you should write them down in your thoughts section so you can remember it on the next step and execute them then.
- The only commands you are not capable of executing are interactive commands like `python` or `node` by themselves.
- If you think that you have completed the task that has been given to you based on your previous actions and outputs then use ``` exit ``` as the command to let the system know that you are done.
- DO NOT make any copies of your previous memories those will be provided to you at each step, making copies just wastes time and energy. Think smarter not harder.
- The write and edit commands requires proper indentation in the content section ex. `write hw.py def hello():\n    print(\'Hello World\')` this is how you would have to format your write command.
    - The white spaces matter as the code changes will be added to the code so they must have proper syntax.

This is a template using the format described above
Items in <> are suggestions for you, fill them out based on the context of the problem you are solving.

[ FORMAT ]
Thoughts:
<Provide clear and concise thoughts on the next step to take, highlighting any important details or context that should be remembered.>
<You can use multiple lines to express your thoughts>

Action:
```
<command> <params>
```
[ END FORMAT ]

Do not provide anything extra just your thought and action.

Please come up with a thought and action based on your current task and latest steps.
Make sure that you do not repeat the same actions, there will not be any changes in result if you do not changes anything.
Be very strict about the formatting that you use and make sure you follow the guidelines.
NEVER output multiple commands. ONLY take ONE STEP at a time.
When you have completed your task run the "exit" command.
Begin with your thought about the next step and then come up with an action to perform your thought.
