# GPT-4 Examples:

### Notes:
- The final result is not completed as I only gave it 10 steps, but shows very promising use of the tools.
- This whole run costs: $0.35 using gpt-4-turbo
  - Input Tokens: 29,734
  - Completion Tokens: 1,636

Interesting things:
1. Using comments as an initial placeholder for the next move and then having that output in memory is a very cool behavior.
2. It makes very small iterative changes due to the prompting.
3. A lot of the logic for the game is present but not put together well
4. There are a lot of odd quirks with the code that it has written.
5. Some odd agent behavior with putting random lines of code in random places?
6. The structure of the feedback loop needs some improvement so the agent can see the changes it has made better in context.
7. Might be beneficial to add in some line numbers so the model knows what lines it is looking at.

To start implementing Conway's Game of Life in Python using the pygame library, I first need to set up a Python script file where I can write the code.
