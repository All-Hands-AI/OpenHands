PLAN:
Please make conway's game of life in python using the pygame library. You can use `pip install <package_name>` to install python packages. Be sure to use the tools in your workspace to help you out.

ACTION:
CmdRunAction(command='pip install pygame', background=False, action=<ActionType.RUN: 'run'>)

OBSERVATION:
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
Requirement already satisfied: pygame in /home/devin/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (2.5.2)
