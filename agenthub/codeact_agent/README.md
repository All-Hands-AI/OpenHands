# CodeAct-based Agent Framework

This folder implements the [CodeAct idea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13463) that relies on LLM to autonomously perform actions in a Bash shell. It requires more from the LLM itself: LLM needs to be capable enough to do all the stuff autonomously, instead of stuck in an infinite loop. 

**NOTE: This agent is still highly experimental and under active development to reach the capability described in the original paper & [repo](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act).**

*Demo of the expected capability - work-in-progress.*

```bash
mkdir workspace
PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH python3 opendevin/main.py -d ./workspace -c CodeActAgent -t "Please write a flask app that returns 'Hello, World\!' at the root URL, then start the app on port 5000. python3 has already been installed for you."
```

Example: prompts `gpt-4-0125-preview` to write a flask server, install `flask` library, and start the server.

Most of the things are working as expected, except at the end, the model did not follow the instruction to stop the interaction by outputting `<execute> exit </execute>` as instructed. 

**TODO**: This should be fixable by either (1) including a complete in-context example like [this](https://github.com/xingyaoww/mint-bench/blob/main/mint/tasks/in_context_examples/reasoning/with_tool.txt), OR (2) collect some interaction data like this and fine-tune a model (like [this](https://github.com/xingyaoww/code-act), a more complex route).
