It serves content on two paths:\n\n- `/` responds with `Hello World`\n- `/test` responds with a simple HTML page containing a `<h1>` tag with `Test Page`.\n\n### Running the Server\nTo run the server, use the following command:\n\n```\npython3 server.py\n```\n\nThe server will start on port 8000. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` for the Hello World message or `http://localhost:8000/test` for the test page.\n\n### Stopping the Server\nTo stop the server, you will need to kill the process manually. If you started the server in the background using this environment, use the `kill` action with the correct process ID.\n\n### Modifications\nThis server has been modified to handle requests to different paths, demonstrating basic routing capabilities.\n\n### Future Improvements\n- Implement error handling for unexpected paths more gracefully.\n- Optimize server performance for handling simultaneous requests.\n- Add logging functionality for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n'}
