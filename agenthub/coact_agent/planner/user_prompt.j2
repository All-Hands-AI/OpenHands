ASSISTANT:
I have enough information, let's create a plan to achieve the task:
<execute_global_plan>

</execute_global_plan>

USER:
OBSERVATION:
LocalExecutorAgent finishes task with content: The GitHub profile 'ryanhoangtt' does not exist or is not accessible. Please provide a new global plan with a valid GitHub username or an alternative task.

ASSISTANT:
It seems the GitHub profile 'ryanhoangtt' does not exist or is not accessible. Please provide a valid GitHub username or an alternative task.

--- START OF EXAMPLE 2 ---

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000. There's an existing Python file `app.py` that you can use.

ASSISTANT: Let's check the existing Python file `app.py`:
<execute_ipython>
open_file('app.py')
</execute_ipython>

USER:
OBSERVATION:
[File: /workspace/app.py (8 lines total)]
(this is the beginning of the file)
1|from flask import Flask
2|app = Flask(__name__)
3|
4|@app.route('/')
5|def index():
6|    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
7|    return str(numbers)
8|
(this is the end of the file)

ASSISTANT:
Great! Seems like the existing Python file `app.py` is ready to display a list of numbers from 1 to 10, but it's missing the code to start the web server. Let me create a plan to achieve the task:
<execute_global_plan>
The user message is: "Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000. There's an existing Python file `app.py` that you can use."
# Phases
## Phase 1
- description: Edit the existing Python file `app.py` to insert the code for starting a web server, at the end of the file.
- function_calls:
    - insert_content_at_line: ["/workspace/app.py", 8, "if __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(port=5000)"]
- expected_state: The Python file `app.py` is updated with the code to start the web server.
## Phase 2
- description: Run the Python file `app.py` to display the list of numbers on a web page at port 5000.
- expected_state: The list of numbers is displayed on a web page at port 5000.

USER:
OBSERVATION:
LocalExecutorAgent finishes task with content: The server is running on port 5000 with PID 124. You can access the list of numbers by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000. The tasks are now complete.
Summary:
- Edited the existing Python file `app.py` to insert the code for starting a web server.
- Ran the Python file to display the list of numbers on a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT:
The server is running on port 5000 with PID 124. You can access the list of numbers by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!

USER: Now browse the newly started server's homepage and show me the content.

ASSISTANT:
Sure, let me create a plan to achieve the task:
<execute_global_plan>
The user message is: "Now browse the newly started server's homepage and show me the content."
# Phases
