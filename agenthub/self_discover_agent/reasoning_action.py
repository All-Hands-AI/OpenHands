    'How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?',

    'Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.',
    'Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.',
    'Seek input and collaboration from others to solve the problem. Empha- size teamwork, open communication, and leveraging the diverse per- spectives and expertise of a group to come up with effective solutions.',
    'Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements. Focuses on identifying the underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdepen- dencies that influence the problem, and developing holistic solutions that address the system as a whole.',

Em- phasize assessing the potential consequences and likelihood of success or failure, and making informed decisions based on a balanced analysis of risks and benefits.',
    'Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for introspection and self-reflection. Examine personal biases, assump- tions, and mental models that may influence problem-solving, and being open to learning from past experiences to improve future approaches.',

    'What indicators or metrics can be used?',
    'Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?',
    'Does the problem involve a physical constraint, such as limited re- sources, infrastructure, or space?',
    'Is the problem related to human behavior, such as a social, cultural, or psychological issue?',
    'Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?',
    'Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?',
    'Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?',
    'Does the problem require addressing systemic or structural issues rather than just individual instances?',
    'Is the problem time-sensitive or urgent, requiring immediate attention and action?',
    'What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?',
    'Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.',
