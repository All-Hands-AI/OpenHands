RESPONSE_FORMAT = '''
This is the format of the response you will make in order to solve the current issue.
You will be given multiple iterations to complete this task so break it into steps and solve them one by one.

Your output must contain the following:
- First, think about what your next action should be and plan it out. you will have a memory of your thoughts so you can use this to remember things for the next step.
- Second, create a piece of code that will execute your next action based on the thoughts you have.
    - The code MUST be surrounded in triple back ticks EXACTLY like this: ```\n<code>\n```

This is a template using the format described above
Items in <> are suggestions for you, fill them out based on the context of the problem you are solving.
Format:
    Thoughts:
    <Provide clear and concise thoughts on the next steps to take, highlighting any important details or context that should be remembered.>
    Action to execute:
    ```
    <command> <params>
    ```

Notes:
- If you give more than one command as your output then only the last command in your output will be executed.
- To execute multiple commands you should write them down in your thoughts so you can remember it on the next step and execute them then.
- The only commands you are not capable of executing are interactive commands like `python` or `vim`.
- When you have finished the task you should run the `exit` command so the system knows you have finished.
- The write command requires proper indentation in the content section ex. `write hw.py def hello():\n    print(\'Hello World\')` this is how you would have to format your write command.
    - The white spaces matter as the code changes will be added to the code so they must have proper syntax.

GENERAL_GUIDELINES = '''INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. You can use any bash commands or custom commands you wish to complete your task. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can indicate that you are done by running the exit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.

NOTE ABOUT THE write COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!

IMPORTANT TIPS:
1. Reproduce the bug: Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issue discusses. If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment and run it to ensure you can reproduce the bug. Then, start trying to fix it. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the issue has indeed been resolved.

   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file, so that you can be sure the script ran fine all the way through.

2. Try different commands: If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it.

3. Navigate large files: If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, you would use the 'read' command like this: 'read <file> 583'. This is a much faster way to read through the file.

4. Handle input files: If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as 'buggy-input.png', and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repository code to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: 'search_dir "buggy-input.png"'. If that doesn't work, use the Linux 'find' command.

5. Understand your context: Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory. The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory.

6. Verify your edits: When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.

7. Thoroughly test your solution: After making any changes to fix a bug, be sure to thoroughly test your solution to ensure the bug has been resolved. Re-run the bug reproduction script and verify that the issue has been addressed.
