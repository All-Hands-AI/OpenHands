    """The issue described in the problem relates to how the separability matrix is computed for nested `CompoundModel`s. Specifically, it seems that the logic used in the `_separable` function may not be accurately assessing the separability of outputs when dealing with nested models.

The main point of failure appears to be in how the separability is calculated when combining the left and right components of nested models. The current logic does not properly account for the case where the outputs of one compound model (like `cm`) are completely independent of those of another model (like `m.Pix2Sky_TAN()`), which leads to incorrect matrix entries.

To address this issue, we can modify how the separability for nested compound models is handled. We can ensure that if both left and right models are separable individually, their combination should also be treated as separable.

### Explanation:
1. The `return` statement in `_separable` was modified. If both `sepleft` and `sepright` are entirely separable (i.e., all elements are `True`), we create an identity matrix that indicates full separability across the combined outputs.
2. This change ensures that when two fully separable models are combined, the resulting separability reflects this independence, thereby fixing the issue seen with nested `CompoundModel`s.

This should resolve the issue where the separability matrix incorrectly suggests that outputs from different models are no""",

The problem appears to stem from how the `_separable` function handles the separability of the left and right components of a compound model.
