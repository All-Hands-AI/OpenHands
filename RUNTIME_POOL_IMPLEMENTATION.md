# Runtime Pool Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a Runtime Pool feature to OpenHands that maintains a pool of pre-connected runtime instances to improve performance by reducing runtime initialization latency.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Implementation

1. **`openhands/runtime/pool.py`** - Main implementation
   - `RuntimePool` class: Singleton that manages the pool of runtime instances

   - Runtime reset and cleanup logic

2. **`openhands/runtime/__init__.py`** - Updated
   - Added registration for 'pooled' runtime type
   - Imports `PooledRuntime` class

## Key Features

### RuntimePool Class

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single pool instance across application
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `POOLED_RUNTIME_CLASS`, `INITIAL_NUM_WARM_SERVERS`, `TARGET_NUM_WARM_SERVERS`
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Uses `queue.Queue` and locks for concurrent access
- **Maintenance Thread**: Background thread maintains target pool size
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to normal runtime creation when pool is empty
- **Proper Cleanup**: Teardown method cleans up all resources

### PooledRuntime Class

- **Proxy Pattern**: Delegates all method calls to actual runtime instance
- **Lazy Connection**: Only gets runtime from pool when `connect()` is called
- **Transparent Interface**: Implements all abstract methods from base `Runtime` class
- **Pool Integration**: Returns runtime to pool on `close()` instead of destroying
- **Error Handling**: Raises clear errors when used before connection

### Runtime Lifecycle

1. **Warm-up**: Pre-create runtimes during pool setup
2. **Allocation**: Get runtime from pool when needed
3. **Usage**: Use runtime normally through proxy
4. **Reset**: Clean runtime state when returned to pool
5. **Reuse**: Reset runtime available for next allocation

## Configuration

Environment variables control pool behavior:

```bash
# Enable pooling for local runtime
export POOLED_RUNTIME_CLASS=local

# Create 2 runtimes at startup
export INITIAL_NUM_WARM_SERVERS=2

# Maintain 4 warm runtimes
export TARGET_NUM_WARM_SERVERS=4
```

## Usage

```python
from openhands.runtime import get_runtime_cls

# Get pooled runtime class
runtime_cls = get_runtime_cls('pooled')

# Create instance
runtime = runtime_cls(config, event_stream)

# Connect (gets from pool)
await runtime.connect()

# Use normally
result = runtime.run(action)

# Close (returns to pool)
runtime.close()
```

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Latency**: No runtime initialization delay for most requests
- **Resource Reuse**: Expensive runtime resources are reused
- **Scalability**: Pool size tunable based on load
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded pool size prevents memory leaks

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety
- Uses `queue.Queue` for thread-safe pool operations
- Locks protect critical sections and shared state
- Background maintenance thread safely manages pool size

### Error Handling
- Failed runtime creation logged but doesn't stop pool
- Runtime reset failures cause runtime to be discarded
- Pool exhaustion gracefully falls back to new runtime creation

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup during teardown
- Failed runtimes not returned to pool
- Bounded pool size prevents unbounded growth

## Integration Points

### Application Startup
```python
from openhands.runtime.pool import RuntimePool

# During app startup
pool = RuntimePool.get_instance()
pool.setup(config)
```

### Application Shutdown
```python
# During app shutdown
pool = RuntimePool.get_instance()
if pool.enabled:
    pool.teardown()
```

### Runtime Creation
```python
# Use 'pooled' runtime type
runtime_cls = get_runtime_cls('pooled')
runtime = runtime_cls(config, event_stream)
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- Pool initialization and configuration
- Runtime allocation and return
- Proxy method delegation
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Pool disabled scenarios
- Thread safety and concurrent access

## Monitoring

Pool provides detailed logging:
- Pool setup and teardown events
- Runtime creation and allocation
- Pool size changes
- Error conditions and failures

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Per-session pool isolation
- Multiple runtime class pooling
- Pool size auto-scaling
- Metrics and monitoring integration
- Health checks for pooled runtimes

## Compatibility

- Fully backward compatible
- Pool is disabled by default
- No changes to existing runtime interfaces
- Graceful fallback when pool unavailable
