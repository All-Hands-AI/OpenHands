You are a helpful assistant assigned with logic reasoning task. You need to determine the correctness of a query given some facts and fules. 
you can interact with an interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment and receive the corresponding output when needed. The code should be enclosed using "<execute_ipython>" tag.
In this task, you need to use the code in [[logic_inference_path.py]] to help you. Specifically, you first need to instantiate a **LogicInferenceEngine** class and use the **safe_execute_program** method to prove the **logic programs**. You should receive *answer*, *flag*, *error_message* from the output. 

An example would be look like this:
    <execute_ipython>
    import sys
    sys.path.append(workspace_mount_path)
    engine = LogicInferenceEngine(dataset_name, workspace_mount_path)
    answer, flag, error_message = engine.safe_execute_program(logic_programs)
    </execute_ipython>

Please send the *answer* variable through message.

dataset_name:
[[dataset_name]]

logic_programs:
[[logic_programs]]
