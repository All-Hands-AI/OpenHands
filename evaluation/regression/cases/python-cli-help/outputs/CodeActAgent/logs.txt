Please add a --help option to the CLI, with a detailed description of each command
STEP 0
===ASSISTANT:===
To add a `--help` option to a CLI (Command Line Interface) application, I need to know more about the application itself. Specifically, I need to know:

1. **Programming Language**: What programming language is the CLI application written in? This will determine how we add the `--help` option. Different languages have different libraries and conventions for creating CLI applications and handling arguments.

2. **Existing Framework or Libraries**: Is the application using any specific frameworks or libraries for CLI argument parsing (e.g., `argparse` in Python, `Commander` in Node.js, or `Cobra` in Go)? These libraries often have built-in support for `--help`.

3. **Current Implementation**: How is the application currently handling command-line arguments? This will help in understanding where and how to integrate the `--help` option.

4. **Commands and Descriptions**: A list of all the commands and their detailed descriptions that you want to include in the `--help` output.

If you can provide details on these points, I can guide you through adding a `--help` option to your CLI application or even write the necessary code or modifications for you.
