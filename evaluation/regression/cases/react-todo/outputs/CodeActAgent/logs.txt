Write a simple TODO list application in React
STEP 0
===ASSISTANT:===
To create a simple TODO list application in React, we'll start by setting up a new React project. Then, we'll write the necessary components for the application.

First, let's create a new React project named "todo-list":

<execute>npx create-react-app todo-list</execute>
===ENV OBSERVATION:===
/bin/bash: line 1: npx: command not found

==============
STEP 1
===ASSISTANT:===
It seems that I can't directly execute commands to create a React project in this environment. However, I can guide you through the process and provide you with the code you need to set up a simple TODO list application in React.

### Step 1: Create a New React Project

First, you need to create a new React project on your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-list
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Change into your newly created project directory:

```bash
cd todo-list
```

### Step 3: Replace the App.js Content

Open the `src/App.js` file in your favorite code editor and replace its content with the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [task, setTask] = useState('');
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const addTask = () => {
    if (!task) return;
    setTasks([...tasks, task]);
    setTask('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>TODO List</h1>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Add a new task"
          value={task}
          onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={addTask}>Add Task</button>
        <ul>
          {tasks.map((task, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{task}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 4: Replace the App.css Content

Optionally, you can also replace the content of `src/App.css` with some basic styles for your TODO list:

```css
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App-header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  color: white;
}

input, button {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: large;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}

li {
  text-align: left;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 5px;
  background-color: #61dafb;
  color: #282c34;
  border-radius: 5px;
  width: 200px;
}
```

### Step 5: Start the Development Server

Finally, start the development server to see your TODO list application in action:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open up your default web browser to `http://localhost:3000` where you'll see your simple TODO list application. You can add tasks to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
===ENV OBSERVATION:===
I don't understand your input. 
If you want to execute command, please use <execute> YOUR_COMMAND_HERE </execute>.
If you already completed the task, please exit the shell by generating: <execute> exit </execute>.
finish {'error': True, 'reason': "I don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute command, please use <execute> YOUR_COMMAND_HERE </execute>.\nIf you already completed the task, please exit the shell by generating: <execute> exit </execute>."}
