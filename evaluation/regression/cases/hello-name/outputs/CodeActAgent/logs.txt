Rewrite the script so that it prints the user's name, using the first argument. If there's no name, default to "world"

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple script that does what you're asking for. This script will check if a name has been provided as the first argument. If not, it will default to "world".

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a name is provided as the first argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Hello, world!"
else
  echo "Hello, $1!"
fi
```

This script uses a basic `if` statement to check if the first argument (`$1`) is empty (`-z`). If it is, it prints "Hello, world!". Otherwise, it prints "Hello, " followed by the first argument.
