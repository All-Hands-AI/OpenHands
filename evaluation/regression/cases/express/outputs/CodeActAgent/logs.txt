Write a simple hello world server in node Express
STEP 0
===ASSISTANT:===
To create a simple "Hello World" server using Node.js and Express, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**: If you don't already have a `package.json` file in your project directory, we'll create one. This file is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, and more.

2. **Install Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

3. **Create the server**: We'll write a small script to create an Express server that listens on a specified port and responds with "Hello World" when the root URL is accessed.

Let's start by initializing a new Node.js project and installing Express.
