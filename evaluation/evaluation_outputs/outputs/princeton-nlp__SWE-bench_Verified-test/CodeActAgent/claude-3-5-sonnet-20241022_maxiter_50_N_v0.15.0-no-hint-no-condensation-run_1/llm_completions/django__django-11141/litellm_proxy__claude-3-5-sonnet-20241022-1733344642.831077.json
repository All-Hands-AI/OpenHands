Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow migrations directories without __init__.py files\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Tim Graham)\n\t \nBackground: In python 3 a package with no __init__.py is implicitly a namespace package, so it has no __file__ attribute. \nThe migrate command currently checks for existence of a __file__ attribute on the migrations package. This check was introduced in #21015, because the __file__ attribute was used in migration file discovery. \nHowever, in #23406 migration file discovery was changed to use pkgutil.iter_modules (), instead of direct filesystem access. pkgutil. iter_modules() uses the package's __path__ list, which exists on implicit namespace packages.\nAs a result, the __file__ check is no longer needed, and in fact prevents migrate from working on namespace packages (implicit or otherwise). \nRelated work: #29091\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.
