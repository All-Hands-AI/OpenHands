This all seems to be working fine, but when I have a custom property (`prop` below) that tries to access a non-existent attribute (`random_attr`) below, the error message is misleading because it says `prop` doesn't exist, where it should say `random_attr` doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport astropy.coordinates as coord\r\n\r\n\r\nclass custom_coord(coord.SkyCoord):\r\n    @property\r\n    def prop(self):\r\n        return self.random_attr\r\n\r\n\r\nc = custom_coord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')\r\nc.prop\r\n```\r\n\r\nraises\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    c.prop\r\n  File \"/Users/dstansby/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/astropy/coordinates/sky_coordinate.py\", line 600, in __getattr__\r\n    .format(self.__class__.__name__, attr))\r\nAttributeError: 'custom_coord' object has no attribute 'prop'\r\n```\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.
