Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nRenameContentType._rename() doesn't save the content type on the correct database\nDescription\n\t\nThe commit in question:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/commit/f179113e6cbc8ba0a8d4e87e1d4410fb61d63e75\nThe specific lines in question:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/586a9dc4295357de1f5ad0590ad34bf2bc008f79/django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py#L27\nwith transaction.atomic(using=db): \n\tcontent_type.save(update_fields={'model'})\nThe issue:\nFor some background, we run a dynamic database router and have no \"real\" databases configured in the settings file, just a default sqlite3 backend which is never actually generated or used. We forked the migrate.py management command and modified it to accept a dictionary containing database connection parameters as the --database argument. \nThe dynamic database router is based on, and very similar to this: \u200bhttps://github.com/ambitioninc/django-dynamic-db-router/blob/master/dynamic_db_router/router.py\nThis has worked beautifully for all migrations up until this point.\nThe issue we're running into is that when attempting to run a migration which contains a call to migrations.RenameModel, and while specifying the database parameters to the migrate command, the migration fails with an OperationalError, stating that no such table: django_content_types exists.\nAfter having exhaustively stepped through the traceback, it appears that even though the content_type.save call is wrapped in the with transaction.atomic(using=db) context manager, the actual database operation is being attempted on the default database (which in our case does not exist) rather than the database specified via schema_editor.connection.alias (on line 15 of the same file) and thus fails loudly.\nSo, I believe that:\ncontent_type.save(update_fields={'model'})\nshould be\ncontent_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n"}, {"type": "text", "text": "<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\".
