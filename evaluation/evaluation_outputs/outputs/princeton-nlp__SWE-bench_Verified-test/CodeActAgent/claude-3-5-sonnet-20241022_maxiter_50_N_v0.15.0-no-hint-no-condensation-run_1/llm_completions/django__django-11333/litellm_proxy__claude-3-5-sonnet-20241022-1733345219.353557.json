Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nOptimization: Multiple URLResolvers may be unintentionally be constructed by calls to `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`\nDescription\n\t\nMultiple URLResolvers may be constructed by django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver if django.urls.base.set_urlconf has not yet been called, resulting in multiple expensive calls to URLResolver._populate.\n\u200b`get_resolver` constructs a new URLResolver, and caches it using functools.lru_cache.\nURLResolver instances can pre-compute a large amount of information about routes in \u200b`URLResolver._populate`, and they store those caches as instance variables.\n\u200b`set_urlconf` is called with when \u200bwe first handle a request in `BaseHandler.get_response`.\nget_resolver has a number of call-sites. Most notably, \u200b`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify \u200b`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.
