Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nunits.quantity_input decorator fails for constructors with type hinted return value -> None\n### Summary\r\nI am using the `units.quantity_input` decorator with typing hints for constructors, however when I add the correct return value for the constructor (`None`) then I get an exception, because `None` has no attribute `to`.\r\n\r\n### Reproducer\r\nThe issue can be reproduced with the following file:\r\n``` Python\r\nimport astropy.units as u\r\n\r\n\r\nclass PoC(object):\r\n\r\n    @u.quantity_input\r\n    def __init__(self, voltage: u.V) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    poc = PoC(1.*u.V)\r\n```\r\nwhich results in the following error:\r\n```\r\n$ python3 poc.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"poc.py\", line 12, in <module>\r\n    poc = PoC(1.*u.V)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/astropy/utils/decorators.py\", line 868, in __init__\r\n    func = make_function_with_signature(func, name=name, **wrapped_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/astropy/units/decorators.py\", line 225, in wrapper\r\n    return return_.to(wrapped_signature.return_annotation)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on Fedora 27 with python 3.6.3, astropy 2.0.2 and numpy 1.13.3 all from Fedora's repository.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nThe issue can be circumvented by not adding the return type typing hint. Unfortunately, then a static type checker cannot infer that this function returns nothing.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\nMaybe the decorator could explicitly check whether None is returned and then omit the unit check.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.
