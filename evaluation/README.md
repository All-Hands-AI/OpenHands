# Evaluation

This folder contains code and resources to run experiments and evaluations.

## For Benchmark Users

### Setup

Before starting evaluation, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md) to setup your local development environment and LLM.

Once you are done with setup, you can follow the benchmark-specific instructions in each subdirectory of the [evaluation directory](#supported-benchmarks).
Generally these will involve running `run_infer.py` to perform inference with the agents.

### Implementing and Evaluating an Agent

To add an agent to OpenHands, you will need to implement it in the [agenthub directory](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub). There is a README there with more information.

To evaluate an agent, you can provide the agent's name to the `run_infer.py` program.

### Evaluating Different LLMs

OpenHands in development mode uses `config.toml` to keep track of most configuration.
**IMPORTANT: For evaluation, only the LLM section in `config.toml` will be used. Other configurations, such as `save_trajectory_path`, are not applied during evaluation.**

Here's an example configuration file you can use to define and use multiple LLMs:

```toml
[llm]
# IMPORTANT: add your API key here, and set the model to the one you want to evaluate
model = "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
api_key = "sk-XXX"

[llm.eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm]
model = "gpt-4-1106-preview"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0

[llm.eval_some_openai_compatible_model_llm]
model = "openai/MODEL_NAME"
base_url = "https://OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL/v1"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0
```

### Configuring Condensers for Evaluation

For benchmarks that support condenser configuration (like SWE-Bench), you can define multiple condenser configurations in your `config.toml` file. A condenser is responsible for managing conversation history to maintain context while staying within token limits - you can learn more about how it works [here](https://www.all-hands.dev/blog/openhands-context-condensensation-for-more-efficient-ai-agents):

```toml
# LLM-based summarizing condenser for evaluation
[condenser.summarizer_for_eval]
type = "llm"
llm_config = "haiku"  # Reference to an LLM config to use for summarization
keep_first = 2        # Number of initial events to always keep
max_size = 100        # Maximum size of history before triggering summarization

# Recent events condenser for evaluation
[condenser.recent_for_eval]
type = "recent"
keep_first = 2        # Number of initial events to always keep
max_events = 50       # Maximum number of events to keep in history
```

You can then specify which condenser configuration to use when running evaluation scripts, for example:

```bash
EVAL_CONDENSER=summarizer_for_eval \
./evaluation/benchmarks/swe_bench/scripts/run_infer.sh llm.eval_gpt4_1106_preview HEAD CodeActAgent 500 100 1 princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified test
```

The name is up to you, but should match a name defined in your `config.toml` file. The last argument in the command specifies the condenser configuration to use. In this case, `summarizer_for_eval` is used, which refers to the LLM-based summarizing condenser as defined above.

If no condenser configuration is specified, the 'noop' condenser will be used by default, which keeps the full conversation history.
```

For other configurations specific to evaluation, such as `save_trajectory_path`, these are typically set in the `get_config` function of the respective `run_infer.py` file for each benchmark.

## Result Visualization

Check [this huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) for visualization of existing experimental results.

You can start your own fork of [our huggingface evaluation outputs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) and submit a PR of your evaluation results to our hosted huggingface repo via PR following the guide [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/repositories-pull-requests-discussions#pull-requests-and-discussions).

## For Benchmark Developers

To learn more about how to integrate your benchmark into OpenHands, check out [tutorial here](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/evaluation-harness). Briefly,

- Each subfolder contains a specific benchmark or experiment. For example, [`evaluation/benchmarks/swe_bench`](./benchmarks/swe_bench) should contain
all the preprocessing/evaluation/analysis scripts.
- Raw data and experimental records should not be stored within this repo.
- For model outputs, they should be stored at [this huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) for visualization.
- Important data files of manageable size and analysis scripts (e.g., jupyter notebooks) can be directly uploaded to this repo.
