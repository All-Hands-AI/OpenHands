# Evaluation

This folder contains code and resources to run experiments and evaluations.

## For Benchmark Users

### Setup

Before starting evaluation, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md) to setup your local development environment and LLM.

Once you are done with setup, you can follow the benchmark-specific instructions in each subdirectory of the [evaluation directory](#supported-benchmarks).
Generally these will involve running `run_infer.py` to perform inference with the agents.

### Implementing and Evaluating an Agent

To add an agent to OpenHands, you will need to implement it in the [agenthub directory](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub). There is a README there with more information.

To evaluate an agent, you can provide the agent's name to the `run_infer.py` program.

### Evaluating Different LLMs

OpenHands in development mode uses `config.toml` to keep track of most configuration.
Here's an example configuration file you can use to define and use multiple LLMs:

```toml
[llm]
# IMPORTANT: add your API key here, and set the model to the one you want to evaluate
model = "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
api_key = "sk-XXX"

[llm.eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm]
model = "gpt-4-1106-preview"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0

[llm.eval_some_openai_compatible_model_llm]
model = "openai/MODEL_NAME"
base_url = "https://OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL/v1"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0
```

## Result Visualization

Check [this huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) for visualization of existing experimental results.

You can start your own fork of [our huggingface evaluation outputs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) and submit a PR of your evaluation results to our hosted huggingface repo via PR following the guide [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/repositories-pull-requests-discussions#pull-requests-and-discussions).

## For Benchmark Developers

To learn more about how to integrate your benchmark into OpenHands, check out [tutorial here](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/evaluation-harness). Briefly,

- Each subfolder contains a specific benchmark or experiment. For example, [`evaluation/benchmarks/swe_bench`](./benchmarks/swe_bench) should contain
all the preprocessing/evaluation/analysis scripts.
- Raw data and experimental records should not be stored within this repo.
- For model outputs, they should be stored at [this huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenHands/evaluation) for visualization.
- Important data files of manageable size and analysis scripts (e.g., jupyter notebooks) can be directly uploaded to this repo.
