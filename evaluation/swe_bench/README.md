# SWE-Bench Evaluation with OpenDevin SWE-Bench Docker Image

This folder contains the evaluation harness that we built on top of the original [SWE-Bench benchmark](https://www.swebench.com/) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770)). We created [a fork of SWE-Bench](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OD-SWE-bench.git) mostly built on top of [the original repo](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench) and [containerized](#opendevin-swe-bench-docker-image) it for easy evaluation.

**UPDATE (7/1/2024): We now support the official SWE-Bench dockerized evaluation as announced [here](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/main/docs/20240627_docker/README.md).**

## Setup Environment

Please follow [this document](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/blob/main/Development.md) to set up a local development environment for OpenDevin.

## OpenDevin SWE-Bench Docker Image

In [OpenDevin-SWE-Bench fork](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OD-SWE-bench.git) (mostly from [original repo](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench) with some fixes), we try to pre-build the **testbed** (i.e., code of the repository we want the agent to edit) AND the **conda environment**, so that in evaluation (inference) time, we can directly leverage existing environments for efficient evaluation.

**We pack everything you need for SWE-Bench inference into one, gigantic, docker image.** To use it:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/opendevin/eval-swe-bench:full-v1.2.1
```

The Docker image contains several important directories:

- `/swe_util/OD-SWE-bench`: root directory for the OD-SWE-bench repository
- `/swe_util/eval_data`: directory to eval data
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/eval_logs/`: evaluation logs
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/eval_temp/`: temporary folder for the evaluation process
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/instances/`: swe-bench raw instances
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/outputs/`: model or agent outputs
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/testbed_logs/`: logs for testbed building
  - `/swe_util/eval_data/testbeds/`: directory for all testbeds
- `/swe_util/miniforge3/`: directory for miniforge3

To reproduce how we pack the image, check [this doc](./BUILD_TESTBED_AND_ENV.md).

NOTE: We only support SWE-Bench lite for now. But modifying our existing scripts for full SWE-Bench should be quite straightforward.

## Configure OpenDevin and your LLM

Create a `config.toml` file if it does not exist at the root of the workspace.

Add the following configurations:

```toml
[core]
max_iterations = 100
cache_dir = "/tmp/cache"
ssh_hostname = "localhost"

[sandbox]
box_type = "ssh"
timeout = 120

run_as_devin = false
max_budget_per_task = 4 # 4 USD

[sandbox]
# SWEBench eval specific
use_host_network = false
enable_auto_lint = true

# TODO: Change these to the model you want to evaluate
[llm.eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm]
model = "gpt-4-1106-preview"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0

[llm.eval_some_openai_compatible_model_llm]
model = "openai/MODEL_NAME"
base_url = "https://OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL/v1"
api_key = "XXX"
temperature = 0.0
```

## Test if your environment works

Make sure your Docker daemon is running, and you have pulled the `eval-swe-bench:full-v1.2`
docker image. Then run this python script:

```bash
# export USE_INSTANCE_IMAGE=true # if you want to test support for instance-level docker images
poetry run python evaluation/swe_bench/swe_env_box.py
```

If you get to the interactive shell successfully, it means your environment works!
If you see an error, please make sure your `config.toml` contains all
`SWEBench eval specific` settings as shown in the previous section.

## Run Inference on SWE-Bench Instances

```bash
./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/run_infer.sh [model_config] [git-version] [agent] [eval_limit] [max_iter] [num_workers]
# e.g., ./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/run_infer.sh eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm HEAD CodeActAgent 300
```

where `model_config` is mandatory, while `agent` and `eval_limit` are optional.

`model_config`, e.g. `eval_gpt4_1106_preview`, is the config group name for your
LLM settings, as defined in your `config.toml`.

`git-version`, e.g. `HEAD`, is the git commit hash of the OpenDevin version you would
like to evaluate. It could also be a release tag like `0.6.2`.

`agent`, e.g. `CodeActAgent`, is the name of the agent for benchmarks, defaulting
to `CodeActAgent`.

`eval_limit`, e.g. `10`, limits the evaluation to the first `eval_limit` instances. By
default, the script evaluates the entire SWE-bench_Lite test set (300 issues). Note:
in order to use `eval_limit`, you must also set `agent`.

`max_iter`, e.g. `20`, is the maximum number of iterations for the agent to run. By
default, it is set to 30.

`num_workers`, e.g. `3`, is the number of parallel workers to run the evaluation. By
default, it is set to 1.

There are also two optional environment variables you can set.
```
export USE_HINT_TEXT=true # if you want to use hint text in the evaluation. Ignore this if you are not sure.
export USE_INSTANCE_IMAGE=true # if you want to use instance-level docker images
```

Let's say you'd like to run 10 instances using `eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm` and CodeActAgent,

then your command would be:

```bash
./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/run_infer.sh eval_gpt4_1106_preview_llm HEAD CodeActAgent 10
```

If you would like to specify a list of tasks you'd like to benchmark on, you could
create a `config.toml` under `./evaluation/swe_bench/` folder, and put a list
attribute named `selected_ids`, e.g.

```toml
selected_ids = ['sphinx-doc__sphinx-8721', 'sympy__sympy-14774', 'scikit-learn__scikit-learn-10508']
```

Then only these tasks (rows whose `instance_id` is in the above list) will be evaluated.
In this case, `eval_limit` option applies to tasks that are in the `selected_ids` list.

After running the inference, you will obtain a `output.jsonl` (by default it will be saved to `evaluation/evaluation_outputs`).

## Evaluate Generated Patches

With `output.jsonl` file, you can run `eval_infer.sh` to evaluate generated patches, and produce a fine-grained report.

**This evaluation is performed using the official dockerized evaluation announced [here](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/main/docs/20240627_docker/README.md).**

If you want to evaluate existing results, you should first run this to clone existing outputs

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenDevin/evaluation evaluation/evaluation_outputs
```

If you have extra local space (e.g., 500GB), you can try pull the [instance-level docker images](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/main/docs/20240627_docker/README.md#choosing-the-right-cache_level) we've prepared to speed up the evaluation by running:

```bash
evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/docker/pull_all_eval_docker.sh instance
```

If you want to save disk space a bit (e.g., with ~50GB free disk space), while speeding up the image pre-build process, you can pull the environment-level docker images:
```bash
evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/docker/pull_all_eval_docker.sh env
```

Then you can run the following:

```bash
# ./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/eval_infer.sh $YOUR_OUTPUT_JSONL
# For example:
./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/eval_infer.sh evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/swe_bench/CodeActAgent/gpt-4-1106-preview_maxiter_50_N_v1.0/output.jsonl
```

PS: You can also pass in a JSONL with [SWE-Bench format](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/blob/main/tutorials/evaluation.md#-creating-predictions) to `./evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/eval_infer.sh`, where each line is a JSON of `{"model_patch": "XXX", "model_name_or_path": "YYY", "instance_id": "ZZZ"}`.

The final results will be saved to `evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/swe_bench/CodeActAgent/gpt-4-1106-preview_maxiter_50_N_v1.0/` with the following files/directory:

- `README.md`: a report showing what are the instances that passed, failed, etc.
- `report.json`: a JSON file that contains keys like `"resolved_ids"` pointing to instance IDs that are resolved by the agent.
- `eval_outputs/`: a directory of test logs

## Visualize Results

First you need to clone `https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenDevin/evaluation` and add your own running results from opendevin into the `outputs` of the cloned repo.

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenDevin/evaluation
```

**(optional) setup streamlit environment with conda**:
```bash
conda create -n streamlit python=3.10
conda activate streamlit
pip install streamlit altair st_pages
```

**run the visualizer**:
Then, in a separate Python environment with `streamlit` library, you can run the following:

```bash
# Make sure you are inside the cloned `evaluation` repo
conda activate streamlit # if you follow the optional conda env setup above
streamlit run 0_ðŸ“Š_OpenDevin_Benchmark.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

Then you can access the SWE-Bench trajectory visualizer at `localhost:8501`.

## Submit your evaluation results

You can start your own fork of [our huggingface evaluation outputs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenDevin/evaluation) and submit a PR of your evaluation results following the guide [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/repositories-pull-requests-discussions#pull-requests-and-discussions).
