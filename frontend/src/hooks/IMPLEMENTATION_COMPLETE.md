# WebSocket Connection Timing Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where `useCreateConversationAndSubscribeMultiple` was connecting to WebSocket immediately after conversation creation, but conversations start with `"STARTING"` status and need to reach `"RUNNING"` status before WebSocket connections can be established.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the original hook with a new implementation that:

1. **Shows immediate toast feedback** when conversation is created
2. **Polls conversation status** using `useQueries` (following Rules of Hooks)
3. **Waits for "RUNNING" status** before establishing WebSocket connection
4. **Automatically dismisses toast** when ready or failed

## Key Technical Improvements

### Rules of Hooks Compliance
- Uses `useQueries` instead of mapping over `useQuery` to avoid Rules of Hooks violations
- Maintains consistent hook call order across renders

### User Experience
- Immediate feedback with toast notification including spinner and conversation link
- Toast automatically dismissed when connection is ready
- Clear messaging about what's happening

### Robust Error Handling
- Handles "STOPPED" status (failed conversations)
- Automatic cleanup of polling and state
- Console warnings for debugging

## Files Modified

1. **`use-create-conversation-and-subscribe-multiple.tsx`**: 
   - Replaced original implementation
   - Renamed from `.ts` to `.tsx` for JSX support
   - Added toast component and polling logic

2. **`frontend/public/locales/en/translation.json`**: 
   - Added `"MICROAGENT$CONVERSATION_STARTING": "OpenHands is starting your conversation. We'll connect you once it's ready."`

## Implementation Details

### Polling Strategy
```typescript
const conversationQueries = useQueries({
  queries: conversationIdsToWatch.map((conversationId) => ({
    queryKey: ["conversation-ready-poll", conversationId],
    queryFn: () => OpenHands.getConversation(conversationId),
    enabled: !!conversationId,
    refetchInterval: (query: any) => {
      const status = query.state.data?.status;
      if (status === "STARTING") {
        return 3000; // Poll every 3 seconds while starting
      }
      return false; // Stop polling once not starting
    },
    retry: false,
  })),
});
```

### Toast Component
- Custom React component with spinner, message, and conversation link
- Automatically dismissed when conversation is ready
- Uses existing TOAST_OPTIONS styling

### State Management
- Stores conversation data immediately after creation
- Cleans up state when WebSocket connection is established
- Supports multiple simultaneous conversations

## User Flow
1. User triggers conversation creation
2. **Immediate**: Toast appears with "OpenHands is starting your conversation..."
3. **Background**: Hook polls conversation status every 3 seconds
4. **When ready**: Toast dismissed, WebSocket connected, success callback triggered
5. **If failed**: Toast dismissed, conversation cleaned up, warning logged

## Backward Compatibility
âœ… **Fully backward compatible** - Same interface as original hook, drop-in replacement

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE AND ACTIVE** - The new hook is now being used in production code.
