Please investigate the repo to figure out what language is being used, and where tests are located, if there are any.

If there are no tests already in the repo, add a very basic test, using typical testing strategies for the language involved.

If there are existing tests, find a function or method which lacks adequate unit tests, and add unit tests for it. Be sure to respect the projects existing test structures.

Make sure the tests pass before you finish.`;

* correct any typos that you find
* add missing language annotations on codeblocks
* if there are references to other files or other sections of the README, turn them into links
* make sure the readme has an h1 title towards the top
* make sure any existing sections in the readme are appropriately separated with headings

If there are no obvious ways to improve the README, make at least one small change to make the wording clearer or friendlier"`;

Then run any commands necessary to update all dependencies to the latest versions, and make sure the code continues to run correctly and the tests pass. If changes need to be made to the codebase, go ahead and make those changes. You can look up documentation for new versions using the browser if you need to.

If a particular dependency update is causing trouble (e.g. breaking changes that you can't fix), you can revert it and send a message to the user explaining why.

Additionally, if you're able to prune any dependencies that are obviously unused, please do so. You may use third party tools to check for unused dependencies.`;
