# Task List

1. ✅ Explore the codebase to understand the current branch dropdown implementation

2. ✅ Implement search functionality that queries the search endpoint when user types
Search functionality was already implemented using useSearchBranches hook with debounced search
3. ✅ Implement fallback to regular branch listing when search text is removed
Fallback functionality was already implemented - when debouncedSearch is empty, it shows paginated branches
4. ✅ Ensure default branch is displayed first in regular dropdown (not during search)
Added defaultBranch prop to GitBranchDropdown and logic to prioritize it in the options list when not searching
5. ✅ Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly without breaking existing functionality
Frontend build completed successfully, indicating no TypeScript errors
