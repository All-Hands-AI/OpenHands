# Getting Started with the OpenDevin Frontend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start -- --port 3001`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run make-i18n`

Generates the i18n declaration file.\
Run this when first setting up the repository or when updating translations.

### `npm run test`

Runs the available test suites for the application.\
It launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, allowing you to see the results of your tests in real time.

In order to skip all but one specific test file, like the one for the ChatInterface, the following command might be used: `npm run test -- -t "ChatInterface"`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Environment Variables

You can set the environment variables in `frontend/.env` to configure the frontend.
The following variables are available:

```javascript
VITE_BACKEND_HOST="127.0.0.1:3000" // The host of the backend
VITE_USE_TLS="false"               // Whether to use TLS for the backend (includes HTTPS and WSS)
VITE_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY="false"  // Whether to skip verifying the backend's certificate. Only takes effect if `VITE_USE_TLS` is true. Don't use this in production!
VITE_FRONTEND_PORT="3001"          // The port of the frontend
```

You can also set the environment variables from outside the project, like `export VITE_BACKEND_HOST="127.0.0.1:3000"`.

The outside environment variables will override the ones in the `.env` file.
