# Getting Started with the OpenHands Frontend

## Overview

This is the frontend of the OpenHands project. It is a React application that provides a web interface for the OpenHands project.

## Tech Stack

- Remix SPA Mode (React + Vite + React Router)
- TypeScript
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- i18next
- React Testing Library
- Vitest
- Mock Service Worker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- `npm`, `bun`, or any other package manager that supports the `package.json` file

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands.git

# Change the directory to the frontend
cd OpenHands/frontend

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application in Development Mode

We use `msw` to mock the backend API. To start the application with the mocked backend, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

**NOTE: The backend is _partially_ mocked using `msw`. Therefore, some features may not work as they would with the actual backend.**

### Running the Application with the Actual Backend (Production Mode)

There are two ways to run the application with the actual backend:

```sh
# Build the application from the root directory
make build

# Start the application
make start
```

OR

```sh
# Start the backend from the root directory
make start-backend

# Build the frontend
cd frontend && npm run build

# Serve the frontend
npm start -- --port 3001
```
