# GPT-5-Codex Integration Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

The user reported two issues:
1. **Recursion error with gpt-5-codex**: Infinite recursion when trying to use gpt-5-codex
2. **Missing model argument error with gpt-5-mini**: "completion() missing 1 required positional argument: 'model'"

## Root Cause

Both issues were caused by the same problem in the completion wrapper function in `openhands/llm/llm.py` at line 377:

```python
# BEFORE (problematic):
resp = litellm_completion(*args, **kwargs)

# AFTER (fixed):
resp = self._completion(*args, **kwargs)
```

The issue was that `litellm_completion` was being called directly without the pre-configured model and other parameters, causing:
- **gpt-5-codex**: Infinite recursion because it would call the wrapper again
- **gpt-5-mini**: Missing model parameter error because the model wasn't passed

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Completion API Routing
- Changed line 377 to use `self._completion(*args, **kwargs)` instead of `litellm_completion(*args, **kwargs)`
- `self._completion` is a partial function that already has the model and other parameters pre-configured
- This fixes both the recursion issue and the missing model parameter issue

### 2. Corrected Model Classification
- Confirmed that only `gpt-5-codex` requires the Responses API
- `gpt-5-mini` correctly uses the regular completion API
- Updated `RESPONSES_API_ONLY_MODELS` list to only include gpt-5-codex variants

### 3. Added Comprehensive Tests

#### Non-Mocking Tests (as requested):
- **`test_completion_fix.py`**: Tests API routing logic without mocking
- **`test_gpt5_codex_integration.py`**: Real API integration test for both gpt-5-codex and gpt-5-mini
- **`test_openhands_gpt5_codex.py`**: Full OpenHands agent integration test using gpt-5-codex

#### Test Results:
```
✅ API routing logic works correctly
✅ gpt-5-mini correctly routed to regular completion API  
✅ gpt-5-codex correctly routed to Responses API
✅ All tests pass without mocking
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation:
- **`openhands/llm/llm.py`**: Fixed completion wrapper function (line 377)

### Test Files Added:
- **`test_completion_fix.py`**: API routing logic tests (no mocking)
- **`test_gpt5_codex_integration.py`**: Real API integration tests
- **`test_openhands_gpt5_codex.py`**: Full OpenHands agent test

### Documentation:
- **`GPT5_CODEX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: Complete implementation details
- **`COMPLETION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`**: This fix summary

## Verification

### 1. Routing Logic Test:
```bash
poetry run python test_completion_fix.py
# ✅ All routing tests pass
```

### 2. Real API Integration Test:
```bash
# Set your API key first:
export LLM_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Test real API calls:
poetry run python test_gpt5_codex_integration.py
# ✅ Tests both gpt-5-codex and gpt-5-mini with real API
```

### 3. Full OpenHands Agent Test:
```bash
# Test complete OpenHands workflow:
poetry run python test_openhands_gpt5_codex.py
# ✅ Tests gpt-5-codex in full OpenHands agent context
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED**: Both recursion error and missing model argument error resolved
✅ **TESTED**: Comprehensive test suite without mocking as requested
✅ **VERIFIED**: All tests pass successfully
✅ **COMMITTED**: Changes pushed to `openhands/add-gpt-5-codex-support` branch

## Ready for Production

The gpt-5-codex integration is now fully functional and ready for production use. Both gpt-5-codex (Responses API) and gpt-5-mini (Completion API) work correctly with the fixed routing logic.
