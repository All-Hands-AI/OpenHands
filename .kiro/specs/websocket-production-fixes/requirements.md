# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses websocket connection errors and reliability issues occurring in production environments. The OpenHands application uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between the frontend and backend, and users are experiencing connection failures, disconnections, and event delivery issues in production deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a production user, I want websocket connections to be stable and reliable, so that I can maintain uninterrupted conversations with the agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the websocket THEN the connection SHALL be established within 5 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN network connectivity is temporarily lost THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
3. WHEN a connection is re-established THEN the system SHALL resume from the last known event ID to prevent message loss
4. WHEN connection attempts fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of websocket connections, so that I can diagnose and resolve production issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN websocket connections are established or terminated THEN the system SHALL log connection events with timestamps and user identifiers
2. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including error codes, stack traces, and connection parameters
3. WHEN websocket events are sent or received THEN the system SHALL log event types and sizes for debugging purposes
4. WHEN connection metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL emit alerts for monitoring systems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a production user, I want websocket connections to handle high load and concurrent users gracefully, so that the system remains responsive during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent websocket connections without degradation
2. WHEN message throughput is high THEN the system SHALL process events without blocking or dropping messages
3. WHEN server resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement proper backpressure mechanisms
4. WHEN connection limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue new connections or provide graceful degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a production user, I want websocket authentication and authorization to be secure and reliable, so that my conversations remain private and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to connect THEN the system SHALL validate authentication credentials before establishing the connection
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL refuse the connection with appropriate error codes
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully disconnect and prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN authorization is checked THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions for the specific conversation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a production user, I want websocket connections to work reliably across different network configurations and proxy setups, so that I can use the system from various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting through corporate proxies THEN the websocket connection SHALL establish successfully
2. WHEN using load balancers THEN the system SHALL maintain session affinity for websocket connections
3. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt connection parameters appropriately
4. WHEN using different transport protocols THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully from websockets to polling if needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for websocket connections, so that the system can gracefully handle edge cases and failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid conversation IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages and refuse connection
2. WHEN malformed events are received THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other events
3. WHEN event replay fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to maintain conversation continuity
4. WHEN server restarts occur THEN the system SHALL allow clients to reconnect and resume conversations seamlessly
