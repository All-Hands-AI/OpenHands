# Action Execution Server Logging Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive logging improvements added to the Action Execution Server to help debug issues like files disappearing and provide better observability into action execution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Action Execution Logging

Added structured logging to the main action execution flow in `ActionExecutor.run_action()`:

- **Action Start Logging**: Logs when each action begins execution with metadata
- **Action Success Logging**: Logs successful completion with execution time and observation metadata
- **Action Failure Logging**: Logs failures with error details and execution time
- **Execution Timing**: Tracks and logs execution time in milliseconds for performance monitoring

### 2. Metadata Extraction Functions

Added two new helper methods to extract relevant metadata while excluding large content:

#### `_extract_action_metadata(action: Action) -> dict[str, Any]`
Extracts metadata from actions including:
- **File Operations**: Path, line ranges, content lengths (not actual content)
- **Commands**: Command text (truncated if >200 chars), blocking status, working directory
- **IPython**: Code length and preview (truncated if >100 chars)
- **Browser Actions**: URLs and action counts
- **Common**: Timeout values, action IDs

#### `_extract_observation_metadata(observation) -> dict[str, Any]`
Extracts metadata from observations including:
- **Common**: Observation type, error status, content lengths
- **File Operations**: File paths, content previews (truncated)
- **Commands**: Exit codes, output lengths
- **Errors**: Error messages (truncated to 200 chars)
- **File Edits**: Diff information and content lengths

### 3. HTTP Endpoint Logging

Enhanced the `/execute_action` endpoint with:
- **Request Logging**: Logs incoming action requests with action type and ID
- **Response Logging**: Logs completed requests with total request time
- **Error Logging**: Logs HTTP-level errors with timing information

### 4. Operation-Specific Logging

Added detailed logging to individual action handlers:

#### File Operations
- **Read Operations**: Logs file read attempts, success/failure, file types, sizes
- **Write Operations**: Logs file write attempts, directory creation, file existence checks
- **Edit Operations**: Logs edit attempts, success/failure, diff information
- **Error Handling**: Logs specific error types (file not found, permission errors, etc.)

#### Command Execution
- **Command Logging**: Logs command execution with previews and parameters
- **Result Logging**: Logs exit codes, output lengths, success status
- **Error Logging**: Logs command execution failures with error details

#### IPython Execution
- **Code Logging**: Logs IPython code execution with code previews
- **Result Logging**: Logs execution results and output lengths
- **Working Directory**: Logs directory changes and synchronization

#### File Management Endpoints
- **File Listing**: Logs directory listing operations with entry counts
- **File Upload**: Logs file upload operations with file details and types
- **File Download**: Logs download operations with file counts and zip creation

### 5. Structured Logging Format

All logs use structured logging with the `extra` parameter to include:
- **Operation Type**: Identifies the type of operation being performed
- **Metadata**: Relevant metadata specific to each operation
- **Timing**: Execution times where applicable
- **Success/Failure**: Clear indication of operation outcomes
- **Error Details**: Comprehensive error information when failures occur

## Benefits for Debugging

### File Disappearance Issues
The enhanced logging will help debug file disappearance by:
- Tracking all file operations (read, write, edit, delete)
- Logging file existence checks and directory operations
- Recording file sizes and modification details
- Capturing permission and ownership changes
- Logging file upload/download operations

### Performance Monitoring
- Execution timing for all actions
- Request processing times
- File operation performance
- Command execution duration

### Error Tracking
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- Error categorization (file not found, permission errors, etc.)
- Stack traces for unexpected failures
- Request-level error tracking

### Operational Visibility
- Action execution patterns
- File system activity
- Command execution frequency
- Resource usage patterns

## Log Levels Used

- **INFO**: Action execution start/completion, successful operations
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operation logging, file system operations, request/response details
- **WARNING**: Non-fatal errors, permission issues, missing files
- **ERROR**: Action failures, HTTP errors, unexpected exceptions

## Content Exclusion

To prevent log bloat, the following content is excluded or truncated:
- File contents (only lengths and previews logged)
- Large command outputs (only lengths logged)
- Long error messages (truncated to 200 characters)
- Code content (only lengths and previews logged)

## Example Log Entries

```
INFO - Executing action: read - action_type=read, action_id=123, action_metadata={'path': '/workspace/file.txt', 'start': 1, 'end': 10}
DEBUG - Attempting to read file: /workspace/file.txt - operation=file_read, path=/workspace/file.txt, working_dir=/workspace
DEBUG - Successfully read text file: /workspace/file.txt - operation=file_read, path=/workspace/file.txt, file_type=text, lines_read=10
INFO - Action completed successfully: read - action_type=read, execution_time_ms=45.2, observation_type=FileReadObservation, success=true
```

This comprehensive logging will provide the visibility needed to debug complex issues like file disappearance while maintaining reasonable log sizes and performance.
