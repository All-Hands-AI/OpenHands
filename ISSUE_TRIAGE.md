# Issue Triage
These are the procedures and guidelines on how issues are triaged in this repo by the maintainers.

## General
* Most issues must be tagged with **enhancement** or **bug**
* Issues may be tagged with what it relates to (**backend**, **frontend**, **agent quality**, etc.)

## Severity
* **Low**: Minor issues, single user report
* **Medium**: Affecting multiple users
* **Critical**: Affecting all users or potential security issues

## Effort
* Issues may be estimated with effort required (**small effort**, **medium effort**, **large effort**)

## Difficulty
* Issues with low implementation difficulty may be tagged with **good first issue**

## Not Enough Information
* User is asked to provide more information (logs, how to reproduce, etc.) when the issue is not clear
* If an issue is unclear and the author does not provide more information or respond to a request, the issue may be closed as **not planned** (Usually after a week)

## Multiple Requests/Fixes in One Issue
* These issues will be narrowed down to one request/fix so the issue is more easily tracked and fixed
* Issues may be broken down into multiple issues if required
