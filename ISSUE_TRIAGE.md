# Issue Triage
These are the procedures and guidelines on how issues are triaged in this repo by the maintainers.

## General
* All issues must be tagged with **enhancement**, **bug** or **troubleshooting/help**.
* Issues may be tagged with what it relates to (**agent quality**, **frontend**, **resolver**, etc.).

## Severity
* **Low**: Minor issues or affecting single user.
* **Medium**: Affecting multiple users.
* **High**: High visibility issues or affecting many users.
* **Critical**: Affecting all users or potential security issues.

## Effort
* Issues may be estimated with effort required (**small effort**, **medium effort**, **large effort**).

## Difficulty
* Issues with low implementation difficulty may be tagged with **good first issue**.

## Not Enough Information
* User is asked to provide more information (logs, how to reproduce, etc.) when the issue is not clear.
* If an issue is unclear and the author does not provide more information or respond to a request,
the issue may be closed as **not planned** (Usually after a week).

## Multiple Requests/Fixes in One Issue
* These issues will be narrowed down to one request/fix so the issue is more easily tracked and fixed.
* Issues may be broken down into multiple issues if required.

## Stale and Auto Closures
* In order to keep a maintainable backlog, issues that have no activity within 30 days are automatically marked as **Stale**.
* If issues marked as **Stale** continue to have no activity for 7 more days, they will automatically be closed as not planned.
* Issues may be reopened by maintainers if deemed important.
