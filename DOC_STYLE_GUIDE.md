# Documentation Style Guide

## General Writing Principles

- **Clarity & Conciseness**: Always prioritize clarity and brevity. Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex explanations.
Keep sentences short and to the point.
- **Stick to the Goal**: Focus on the topic's main objective. Ensure that the documentation addresses the most common
use cases first and leaves more detailed or advanced configurations for later sections.

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headers

- **First and Second-Level Headers**: Use **Title Case** for the first and second headers.
  Example:
  - **Basic Usage**
  - **Advanced Configuration Options**

### Lists

- **Bullet Points**: When listing items or options, use bullet points to enhance readability.
  Example:
  - Option A
  - Option B
  - Option C

### Procedures

- **Numbered Steps**: For instructions or processes that need to be followed in a specific order, use numbered steps.
  Example:
  1. Step one: Do this.
  2. Step two: Complete this action.
  3. Step three: Verify the result.
