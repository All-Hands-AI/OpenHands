title: Task Microagents
description: Task microagents are specialized workflows triggered by command-style inputs that prompt users for required information. They streamline common development tasks by providing structured templates for specific operations.
---

## Overview

Task microagents are a special type of microagent designed to handle specific workflows that require user input. They are triggered using a command-style format (e.g., `/fix_test`) and will prompt the user for any required inputs before proceeding with the task.

When typing `/` in the chat input, a dropdown of available task microagents appears, making it easier to discover and use these specialized workflows.

## Usage

To use a task microagent:

1. Type `/` in the chat input to see available task microagents
2. Select a microagent from the dropdown or type its name (e.g., `/fix_test`)
3. The agent will prompt you for any required inputs
4. Provide the requested information
5. The agent will execute the task with your inputs

## Frontmatter Syntax

Frontmatter is required for task microagents. It must be placed at the top of the file, enclosed in triple dashes (---).

| Field      | Description                                                | Required | Default          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `name`     | The name of the microagent                                 | Yes      | None             |
| `triggers` | A list of command triggers (e.g., `/fix_test`)             | No       | `/[name]`        |
| `inputs`   | A list of input variables the microagent requires          | Yes      | None             |
| `agent`    | The agent this microagent applies to                       | No       | 'CodeActAgent'   |
| `version`  | The version of the microagent                              | No       | '1.0.0'          |
| `author`   | The author of the microagent                               | No       | None             |

### Input Definition

Each input in the `inputs` list requires:

| Field         | Description                                      | Required |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `name`        | The name of the input variable                   | Yes      |
| `description` | A description of what the input should contain   | Yes      |

## Template Variables

In the body of the microagent, you can reference input variables using the `{{ VARIABLE_NAME }}` syntax. These will be replaced with the user-provided values when the microagent is triggered.

## Example

Here's an example of a task microagent that helps fix failing tests:

```markdown
---
name: fix_test
version: 1.0.0
author: openhands
agent: CodeActAgent
triggers:
- /fix_test
inputs:
  - name: BRANCH_NAME
    description: "Branch for the agent to work on"
  - name: TEST_COMMAND_TO_RUN
    description: "The test command you want the agent to work on. For example, `pytest tests/unit/test_bash_parsing.py`"
  - name: FUNCTION_TO_FIX
    description: "The name of function to fix"
  - name: FILE_FOR_FUNCTION
    description: "The path of the file that contains the function"
---

Can you check out branch "{{ BRANCH_NAME }}", and run {{ TEST_COMMAND_TO_RUN }}.

Help me fix these tests to pass by fixing the {{ FUNCTION_TO_FIX }} function in file {{ FILE_FOR_FUNCTION }}.

PLEASE DO NOT modify the tests by yourself -- Let me know if you think some of the tests are incorrect.
```

When a user types `/fix_test`, OpenHands will prompt them to provide values for:
- The branch name
- The test command to run
- The function name to fix
- The file path containing the function

After receiving these inputs, OpenHands will execute the task with the provided information.

## Available Task Microagents

OpenHands includes several built-in task microagents:

| Command              | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `/fix_test`          | Fix failing tests by modifying a specific function    |
| `/update_test`       | Update tests for a new implementation                 |
| `/update_pr`         | Update a pull request description                     |
| `/address_pr_comments` | Address comments on a pull request                  |
| `/add_repo_instruction` | Add instructions to the repository microagent      |
