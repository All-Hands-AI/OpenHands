title: Overview
description: This section is for users that would like to use a runtime other than Docker for OpenHands.
---

A Runtime is an environment where the OpenHands agent can edit files and run
commands.

By default, OpenHands uses a [Docker-based runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker), running on your local computer.
This means you only have to pay for the LLM you're using, and your code is only ever sent to the LLM.

Additionally, we provide a [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) that runs directly on your machine without Docker,
which can be useful in controlled environments like CI pipelines.

## Available Runtimes

OpenHands supports several different runtime environments:

- [Docker Runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker) - The default runtime that uses Docker containers for isolation (recommended for most users).
- [OpenHands Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) - Cloud-based runtime for parallel execution (beta).
- [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) - Direct execution on your local machine without Docker.
- [Daytona Runtime](/usage/runtimes/daytona) - Runtime provided by Daytona.
- [Third-party Runtimes](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/third-party-runtimes) - These runtimes are supported by their developers, not by OpenHands. Please find them in the repository linked here if you would like to run on third-party infrastructure providers.
