title: Overview
description: This section is for users that would like to use a runtime other than Docker for OpenHands.
---

A Runtime is an environment where the OpenHands agent can edit files and run
commands.

By default, OpenHands uses a [Docker-based runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker), running on your local computer.
This means you only have to pay for the LLM you're using, and your code is only ever sent to the LLM.

Additionally, we provide a [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) that runs directly on your machine without Docker,
which can be useful in controlled environments like CI pipelines.

## Available Runtimes

OpenHands supports several different runtime environments:

- [Docker Runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker) - The default runtime that uses Docker containers for isolation (recommended for most users).
- [OpenHands Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) - Cloud-based runtime for parallel execution (beta).
- [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) - Direct execution on your local machine without Docker.

### Third-Party Runtimes

The following third-party runtimes are available when you install the `third_party_runtimes` extra:

```bash
pip install openhands-ai[third_party_runtimes]
```

- [E2B Runtime](/usage/runtimes/e2b) - Open source runtime using E2B sandboxes.
- [Modal Runtime](/usage/runtimes/modal) - Serverless runtime using Modal infrastructure.
- [Runloop Runtime](/usage/runtimes/runloop) - Cloud runtime using Runloop infrastructure.
- [Daytona Runtime](/usage/runtimes/daytona) - Development environment runtime using Daytona.

**Note**: These third-party runtimes are supported by their respective developers, not by the OpenHands team. For issues specific to these runtimes, please refer to their documentation or contact their support teams.
