## Step 1: Retrieve Your Daytona API Key
1. Visit the [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys).
2. Click **"Create Key"**.
3. Enter a name for your key and confirm the creation.
4. Once the key is generated, copy it.

## Step 2: Set Your API Key as an Environment Variable
Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<your-api-key>` with the actual key you copied:

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:DAYTONA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

This step ensures that OpenHands can authenticate with the Daytona platform when it runs.

## Step 3: Run OpenHands Locally Using Docker
To start the latest version of OpenHands on your machine, execute the following command in your terminal:

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
bash -i <(curl -sL https://get.daytona.io/openhands)
```

### Windows:
```powershell
powershell -Command "irm https://get.daytona.io/openhands-windows | iex"
```

### What This Command Does:
- Downloads the latest OpenHands release script.
- Runs the script in an interactive Bash session.
- Automatically pulls and runs the OpenHands container using Docker.

Once executed, OpenHands should be running locally and ready for use.

6. You can now use the image in your Daytona sandbox.
