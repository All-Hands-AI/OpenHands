## Step 1: Retrieve Your Daytona API Key
1. Visit the [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys).
2. Click **"Create Key"**.
3. Enter a name for your key and confirm the creation.
4. Once the key is generated, copy it.

## Step 2: Set Your API Key as an Environment Variable
Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<your-api-key>` with the actual key you copied:

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

### Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:DAYTONA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

This step ensures that OpenHands can authenticate with the Daytona platform when it runs.

## Step 3: Run OpenHands Locally Using Docker
To start the latest version of OpenHands on your machine, execute the following command in your terminal:

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
bash -i <(curl -sL https://get.daytona.io/openhands)
```

### Windows:
```powershell
powershell -Command "irm https://get.daytona.io/openhands-windows | iex"
```

### What This Command Does:
- Downloads the latest OpenHands release script.
- Runs the script in an interactive Bash session.
- Automatically pulls and runs the OpenHands container using Docker.

Once executed, OpenHands should be running locally and ready for use.
