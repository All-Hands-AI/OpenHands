## Getting Started

### I'm new to OpenHands. Where should I start?

1. **Quick Start**: Use [OpenHands Cloud](/usage/cloud/openhands-cloud) to get started quickly with [GitHub](/usage/cloud/github-installation), [GitLab](/usage/cloud/gitlab-installation), and [Slack](/usage/cloud/slack-installation) integration
2. **Local Setup**: If you prefer to run it on your own hardware, follow our [Getting Started guide](/usage/local-setup)
3. **First steps**: Complete the [start building tutorial](/usage/getting-started) to learn the basics


### Can I use OpenHands for production workloads?

OpenHands is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation. It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.

If you're interested in running OpenHands in a multi-tenant environment, check out the source-available, commercially-licensed [OpenHands Cloud Helm Chart](https://github.com/all-Hands-AI/OpenHands-cloud).

## Safety and Security

### It's doing stuff without asking, is that safe?

**Generally yes, but with important considerations.** OpenHands runs all code in a secure, isolated Docker container (called a "sandbox") that is separate from your host system. However, the safety depends on your configuration:

**What's protected:**
- Your host system files and programs (unless you mount them using [this feature](/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem))
- Host system resources
- Other containers and processes

**Potential risks to consider:**
- The agent can access the internet from within the container
- If you provide credentials (API keys, tokens), the agent can use them
- Mounted files and directories can be modified or deleted
- Network requests can be made to external services

For detailed security information, see our [Runtime Architecture](/usage/architecture/runtime), [Security Configuration](/usage/configuration-options#security-configuration), and [Hardened Docker Installation](/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation) documentation.

## File Storage and Access

### Where are my files stored?

Your files are stored in different locations depending on how you've configured OpenHands:

**Default behavior (no file mounting):**
- Files created by the agent are stored inside the Docker container
- These files are temporary and will be lost when the container is removed
- The agent works in the `/workspace` directory inside the container

**When you mount your local filesystem (following [this](/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem)):**
- Your local files are mounted into the container's `/workspace` directory
- Changes made by the agent are reflected in your local filesystem
- Files persist after the container is stopped

<Warning>
Be careful when mounting your filesystem - the agent can modify or delete any files in the mounted directory.
</Warning>


## Development Tools and Environment

### How do I get the dev tools I need?

OpenHands comes with a basic runtime environment that includes Python and Node.js, but you may need additional development tools for your specific projects.

You have two main options:
- **Use an existing Docker image** that already includes your required tools
- **Create a custom Docker image** with the exact tools you need

For detailed instructions on setting up custom development environments, including examples for different programming languages and tools, see our [Custom Sandbox Guide](/usage/how-to/custom-sandbox-guide).
