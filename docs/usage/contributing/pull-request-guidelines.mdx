# Pull Request Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! This page explains how we prefer pull requests to be opened and reviewed for the OpenHands repository.

## Before opening a PR

- Run the project's pre-commit hooks: make install-pre-commit-hooks && pre-commit run --all-files --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
- Ensure unit tests pass: poetry run pytest ./tests/unit
- For frontend changes: cd frontend && npm run lint:fix && npm run build
- Follow the repository's commit message / PR title conventions. PR titles should use a conventional prefix (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, perf:, test:, build:, ci:, chore:, revert:).

## Branching

- Create a feature branch from main named descriptively, e.g., `feat/add-foo`, `fix/correct-bar`.
- Keep branches small and focused on a single logical change.

## PR Content

- Provide a clear, concise summary of what the PR changes and why.
- Include any relevant screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- If your change affects users, add an end-user friendly changelog entry (see .github/pull_request_template.md).
- Reference any associated issue numbers.

## Review Process

- Assign reviewers if you know who should review; otherwise, leave it to maintainers.
- Respond to review comments promptly.
- Keep changes small when addressing review feedback (use follow-up commits; avoid force-pushing multiple times unless necessary).

## Tests and CI

- Add or update unit tests for behaviour changes.
- Ensure CI checks pass before requesting final review.

## Styling

- Follow the project's linting and formatting rules. Run pre-commit hooks locally to catch common issues.

## Merging

- Maintainers will merge PRs when they are approved and CI passes.
- Do not merge your own PR unless you are a maintainer or have explicit permission.
- Use rebase when integrating changes from main to keep history clean.

## Backporting

- For important bugfixes, maintainers may backport to release branches; discuss backports in PR comments.

## Additional tips

- For large or risky changes, open an issue first to discuss design.
- When in doubt, ask for guidance in our Slack community: https://dub.sh/openhands
