# 🔄 Pull Request Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to OpenHands! This guide will help you create pull requests that are easy to review and get merged quickly.

## 🚀 Before You Start

Before opening your PR, make sure you've completed these steps:

- **Run pre-commit hooks**: `make install-pre-commit-hooks && pre-commit run --all-files --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Test your changes**: `poetry run pytest ./tests/unit`
- **Frontend changes**: `cd frontend && npm run lint:fix && npm run build`
- **Follow naming conventions**: Use conventional prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

Keep your contributions organized:

- **Create descriptive branches** from `main` - like `feat/add-foo` or `fix/correct-bar`
- **Keep it focused** - one logical change per branch
- **Stay current** - regularly sync with the main branch

## 📝 Writing Great PRs

Make your PR easy to understand and review:

- **Clear summary** - Explain what changes and why in plain language
- **Visual proof** - Include screenshots or recordings for UI changes
- **User impact** - Add changelog entries for user-facing changes (see our [PR template](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md))
- **Link issues** - Reference related issue numbers

## 👀 Review Process

Help reviewers help you:

- **Assign reviewers** if you know who should look at your changes
- **Respond promptly** to feedback and questions
- **Small iterations** - Use follow-up commits rather than force-pushing repeatedly

## ✅ Testing & Quality

Ensure your code meets our standards:

- **Add tests** for new functionality or bug fixes
- **Green CI** - Make sure all checks pass before requesting final review
- **Follow style** - Our pre-commit hooks will catch most formatting issues

## 🎯 Getting Merged

The final steps:

- **Maintainer approval** - We'll merge when approved and CI passes
- **Clean history** - We prefer rebasing to keep the git history tidy

## 🔧 Pro Tips

- **Big changes?** Open an issue first to discuss the approach
- **Need help?** Join our [Slack community](https://dub.sh/openhands) for guidance
- **Bug fixes** - Important fixes may be backported to release branches
