## üõ†Ô∏è Becoming a Maintainer

For contributors who have made significant and sustained contributions to the project, there is a possibility of joining the maintainer team. The process for this is as follows:

### Nomination Process

1. **Nomination**: Any contributor who has made sustained and high-quality contributions to the codebase can be nominated by any maintainer. If you feel that you may qualify you can reach out to any of the maintainers that have reviewed your PRs and ask if you can be nominated.

2. **Discussion Period**: Once a maintainer nominates a new maintainer, there will be a discussion period among the maintainers for at least 3 days.

3. **Decision**: If no concerns are raised the nomination will be accepted by acclamation, and if concerns are raised there will be a discussion and possible vote.

### Maintainer Qualities

Note that just making many PRs does not immediately imply that you will become a maintainer. We will be looking at:

- **Sustained high-quality contributions** over a period of time
- **Good teamwork** and collaboration with other contributors
- **Adherence to our [Code of Conduct](/usage/contributing/code-of-conduct)**
- **Technical expertise** in relevant areas
- **Community engagement** and helpfulness to other contributors
