Thanks for your interest in contributing to OpenHands! We welcome and appreciate contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to help advance AI-powered software development.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Ready to contribute? Here's how to get started:

1. **Download and use** OpenHands, and send [issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) when you encounter something that isn't working or a feature that you'd like to see.
2. **Send feedback** after each session by [clicking the thumbs-up thumbs-down buttons](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/feedback), so we can see where things are working and failing, and also build an open dataset for training code agents.
3. **Improve the Codebase** by sending [PRs](#sending-pull-requests-to-openhands) (see details below). In particular, we have some [good first issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/labels/good%20first%20issue) that may be ones to start on.

## üéØ What Can I Build?

Here are several ways you can help improve the codebase:

### UI/UX Improvements
We're always looking to improve the look and feel of the application. If you've got a small fix for something that's bugging you, feel free to open up a PR that changes the [`./frontend`](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/frontend) directory.

If you're looking to make a bigger change, add a new UI element, or significantly alter the style of the application, please open an issue first, or better, join the **#eng-ui-ux** channel in our [Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands) to gather consensus from our design team first.

### Improving the Agent
Our main agent is the CodeAct agent. You can [see its prompts here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent).

Changes to these prompts, and to the underlying behavior in Python, can have a huge impact on user experience. You can try modifying the prompts to see how they change the behavior of the agent as you use the app locally, but we will need to do an end-to-end evaluation of any changes here to ensure that the agent is getting better over time.

We use the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) benchmark to test our agent. You can join the **#evaluation** channel in [Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands) to learn more.

### Adding a New Agent
You may want to experiment with building new types of agents. You can add an agent to [`openhands/agenthub`](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub) to help expand the capabilities of OpenHands.

### Adding a New Runtime
The agent needs a place to run code and commands. When you run OpenHands on your laptop, it uses a Docker container to do this by default. But there are other ways of creating a sandbox for the agent.

If you work for a company that provides a cloud-based runtime, you could help us add support for that runtime by implementing the [interface specified here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/openhands/runtime/base.py).

### Testing
When you write code, it is also good to write tests. Please navigate to the [`./tests`](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/tests) folder to see existing test suites. At the moment, we have two kinds of tests: [`unit`](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/tests/unit) and [`integration`](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/evaluation/integration_tests). Please refer to the README for each test suite. These tests also run on GitHub's continuous integration to ensure quality of the project.

## üìã Understanding OpenHands's CodeBase

To understand the codebase, please refer to the README in each module:
- [frontend](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/frontend/README.md)
- [evaluation](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/evaluation/README.md)
- [openhands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/README.md)
   - [agenthub](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub/README.md)
   - [server](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/server/README.md)

## üîß Setting up Your Development Environment

We have a comprehensive [Development Setup Guide](/contributing/development-setup) that tells you how to set up a development workflow with all the necessary tools and dependencies.

## üí° How to Make Effective Contributions

### Opening Issues

If you notice any bugs or have any feature requests please open them via the [issues page](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues). We will triage based on how critical the bug is or how potentially useful the improvement is, discuss, and implement the ones that the community has interest/effort for.

Further, if you see an issue you like, please leave a "thumbs-up" or a comment, which will help us prioritize.

### Making Pull Requests

We're generally happy to consider all pull requests with the evaluation process varying based on the type of change:

#### For Small Improvements

Small improvements with few downsides are typically reviewed and approved quickly. One thing to check when making changes is to ensure that all continuous integration tests pass, which you can check before getting a review.

#### For Core Agent Changes

We need to be more careful with changes to the core agent, as it is imperative to maintain high quality. These PRs are evaluated based on three key metrics:

1. **Accuracy**
2. **Efficiency**
3. **Code Complexity**

If it improves accuracy, efficiency, or both with only a minimal change to code quality, that's great we're happy to merge it in! If there are bigger tradeoffs (e.g. helping efficiency a lot and hurting accuracy a little) we might want to put it behind a feature flag. Either way, please feel free to discuss on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) or **[Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands)**, and we will give guidance and preliminary feedback.

## ü§ù Join Our Community
