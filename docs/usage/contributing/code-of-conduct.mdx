# ü§ù Code of Conduct

We're committed to making OpenHands a welcoming, inclusive community for everyone. This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values and the standards we expect from all community members.

*This page is based on our repository's [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follows the Contributor Covenant v2.1.*

## üåü Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## ‚úÖ Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## üåç Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (for example, using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event).

## üì¢ Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to our community leaders at **contact@all-hands.dev**. All reports will be reviewed promptly and fairly, and we're committed to protecting the privacy and security of those who report incidents.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences for violations of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## üí¨ Community Chat Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to foster an inclusive, respectful, and productive environment for all community members.

- Communicate respectfully and professionally, avoiding sarcasm or harsh language, and remember that tone can be difficult to interpret in text.
- Use threads for specific discussions to keep channels organized and easier to follow.
- Tag others only when their input is critical or urgent, and use @here, @channel or @everyone sparingly to minimize disruptions.
- Be patient, as open-source contributors and maintainers often have other commitments and may need time to respond.
- Post questions or discussions in the most relevant channel and include necessary details like links and screenshots for context.
- Keep discussions in public channels whenever possible to allow others to benefit from the conversation, unless the matter is sensitive or private.
- Always adhere to the standards in this Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming and collaborative environment.
