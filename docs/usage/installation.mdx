### Start the App

The easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker.

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.40-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.40-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.40
```

You'll find OpenHands running at http://localhost:3000!

You can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem),
run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),
or run it on tagged issues with [a GitHub action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).

### Setup

After launching OpenHands, you **must** select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` and enter a corresponding `API Key`.
This can be done during the initial settings popup or by selecting the `Settings`
button (gear icon) in the UI.

If the required model does not exist in the list, in `Settings` under the `LLM` tab, you can toggle `Advanced` options
and manually enter it with the correct prefix in the `Custom Model` text box.
The `Advanced` options also allow you to specify a `Base URL` if required.

#### Getting an API Key

OpenHands requires an API key to access most language models. Here's how to get an API key from the recommended providers:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Anthropic (Claude)">

1. [Create an Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com/).
2. [Generate an API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
3. [Set up billing](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing).

Consider setting usage limits to control costs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OpenAI">

1. [Create an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/).

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### Setting Up Search Engine

OpenHands can be configured to use a search engine to allow the agent to search the web for information when needed.

Search functionality is enabled by default in OpenHands Cloud. No additional setup is required.

To enable search functionality in self-hosted OpenHands:

1. Get a Tavily API key from [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/)
2. Enter the API key in the Settings page under `LLM` tab, `Search API Key (Tavily)`

For more details, see the [Search Engine Setup](/usage/search-engine-setup) guide.


Now you're ready to [get started with OpenHands](./getting-started).

#### Versions

The [docker command above](./installation#start-the-app) pulls the most recent stable release of OpenHands. You have other options as well:
- For a specific release, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with the version number.
We use SemVer so `0.9` will automatically point to the latest `0.9.x` release, and `0` will point to the latest `0.x.x` release.
- For the most up-to-date development version, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with `main`.
This version is unstable and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.

For the development workflow, see [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).
