### Start the App

The easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker.

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.39-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.39
```

You'll find OpenHands running at http://localhost:3000!

You can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem),
run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),
or run it on tagged issues with [a GitHub action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).

### Setup

After launching OpenHands, you **must** select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` and enter a corresponding `API Key`.
This can be done during the initial settings popup or by selecting the `Settings`
button (gear icon) in the UI.

If the required model does not exist in the list, in `Settings` under the `LLM` tab, you can toggle `Advanced` options
and manually enter it with the correct prefix in the `Custom Model` text box.
The `Advanced` options also allow you to specify a `Base URL` if required.

#### Getting an API Key

OpenHands requires an API key to access most language models. Here's how to get an API key from the recommended providers:

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Now you're ready to [get started with OpenHands](./getting-started).

#### Versions

The [docker command above](./installation#start-the-app) pulls the most recent stable release of OpenHands. You have other options as well:
- For a specific release, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with the version number.
We use SemVer so `0.9` will automatically point to the latest `0.9.x` release, and `0` will point to the latest `0.x.x` release.
- For the most up-to-date development version, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with `main`.
This version is unstable and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.

For the development workflow, see [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).
