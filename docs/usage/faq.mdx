## Safety and Security

### It's doing stuff without asking, is that safe?

**Generally yes, but with important considerations.** OpenHands runs all code in a secure, isolated Docker container (called a "sandbox") that is separate from your host system. However, the safety depends on your configuration:

**What's protected:**
- Your host system files and programs (unless you mount them)
- Host system resources and performance
- Other containers and processes

**Potential risks to consider:**
- The agent can access the internet from within the container
- If you provide credentials (API keys, tokens), the agent can use them
- Mounted files and directories can be modified or deleted
- Network requests can be made to external services

**Security features:**
- Built-in security analyzer to detect potentially risky actions
- Configurable confirmation mode for sensitive operations
- Hardened Docker configurations for production use

For detailed security information, see our [Runtime Architecture](/usage/architecture/runtime), [Security Configuration](/usage/configuration-options#security-configuration), and [Hardened Docker Installation](/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation) documentation.

## File Storage and Access

### Where are my files stored?

Your files are stored in different locations depending on how you've configured OpenHands:

**Default behavior (no file mounting):**
- Files created by the agent are stored inside the Docker container
- These files are temporary and will be lost when the container is stopped
- The agent works in the `/workspace` directory inside the container

**When you mount your local filesystem:**
- Your local files are mounted into the container's `/workspace` directory
- Changes made by the agent are reflected in your local filesystem
- Files persist after the container is stopped

**To connect your local files to OpenHands:**

1. **Using SANDBOX_VOLUMES (recommended):**
   ```bash
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/path/to/your/code:/workspace:rw
   ```

2. **Example for different operating systems:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=$HOME/my-project:/workspace:rw

   # Windows with WSL
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/mnt/c/dev/my-project:/workspace:rw
   ```

**Important:** Be careful when mounting your filesystem - the agent can modify or delete any files in the mounted directory.

For detailed instructions, see our [Docker Runtime documentation](/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem).

## Development Tools and Environment

### How do I get the dev tools I need?

OpenHands comes with a basic runtime environment that includes Python and Node.js, but you may need additional development tools for your specific projects.

You have two main options:
- **Use an existing Docker image** that already includes your required tools
- **Create a custom Docker image** with the exact tools you need

For detailed instructions on setting up custom development environments, including examples for different programming languages and tools, see our [Custom Sandbox Guide](/usage/how-to/custom-sandbox-guide).

## Getting Started

### I'm new to OpenHands. Where should I start?

4. **Report bugs**: If you've found a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/new) with details about your setup and the problem

### Can I use OpenHands for production workloads?

OpenHands is actively developed and used by many teams, but consider these factors for production use:

- **Security**: Review our [security considerations](/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation) for production deployments
- **Reliability**: Test thoroughly with your specific use cases
- **Monitoring**: Implement appropriate logging and monitoring
- **Rate limits**: Be aware of LLM provider rate limits and costs
- **Backup**: Ensure important work is backed up and version controlled

For production deployments, consider using [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev) for managed infrastructure and support.
