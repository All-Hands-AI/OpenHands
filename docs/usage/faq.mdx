## Safety and Security

### It's doing stuff without asking, is that safe?

**Yes, it's safe!** OpenHands runs all code in a secure, isolated Docker container (called a "sandbox") that is completely separate from your host system. This means:

- **No access to your host system**: The agent cannot access files, programs, or data outside the container
- **Isolated environment**: Any code execution happens only within the container
- **Resource control**: The container has limited resources and cannot affect your host machine's performance
- **Easy cleanup**: You can stop or delete the container at any time without affecting your system

The sandbox architecture is specifically designed to allow AI agents to work autonomously while keeping your system secure. Learn more about how this works in our [Runtime Architecture documentation](/usage/architecture/runtime).

## File Storage and Access

### Where are my files stored?

Your files are stored in different locations depending on how you've configured OpenHands:

**Default behavior (no file mounting):**
- Files created by the agent are stored inside the Docker container
- These files are temporary and will be lost when the container is stopped
- The agent works in the `/workspace` directory inside the container

**When you mount your local filesystem:**
- Your local files are mounted into the container's `/workspace` directory
- Changes made by the agent are reflected in your local filesystem
- Files persist after the container is stopped

**To connect your local files to OpenHands:**

1. **Using SANDBOX_VOLUMES (recommended):**
   ```bash
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/path/to/your/code:/workspace:rw
   ```

2. **Example for different operating systems:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=$HOME/my-project:/workspace:rw

   # Windows with WSL
   export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/mnt/c/dev/my-project:/workspace:rw
   ```

**Important:** Be careful when mounting your filesystem - the agent can modify or delete any files in the mounted directory.

For detailed instructions, see our [Docker Runtime documentation](/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem).

## Development Tools and Environment

### How do I get the dev tools I need?

OpenHands comes with a basic runtime environment that includes Python and Node.js, but you may need additional development tools for your specific projects.

**Option 1: Use an existing image with your tools**
- Many pre-built Docker images include common development tools
- You can specify a different base image when starting OpenHands

**Option 2: Create a custom Docker image**
- Build your own Docker image with the exact tools you need
- This is the most flexible approach for complex requirements

**Example: Adding Ruby to your environment**

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.12-nodejs22

# Install Ruby
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby
```

Build and use your custom image:
```bash
docker build -t my-custom-runtime .

# Use your custom image
docker run -it --rm \
    -e SANDBOX_BASE_CONTAINER_IMAGE=my-custom-runtime \
    # ... other options
```

**Common development tools you might want to add:**
- Programming languages (Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
- Build tools (Make, CMake, Maven, Gradle)
- Version control tools (Git is included by default)
- Database clients
- Cloud CLI tools (AWS CLI, gcloud, etc.)
- Docker-in-Docker (for projects that need to build containers)

For step-by-step instructions on creating custom environments, see our [Custom Sandbox Guide](/usage/how-to/custom-sandbox-guide).

## Getting Started

### I'm new to OpenHands. Where should I start?

1. **Installation**: Follow our [Getting Started guide](/usage/local-setup) to install and run OpenHands
2. **First steps**: Complete the [Getting Started tutorial](/usage/getting-started) to learn the basics
3. **Configuration**: Set up your [LLM provider](/usage/llms/llms) and any additional tools you need
4. **Advanced features**: Explore [key features](/usage/key-features) and [configuration options](/usage/configuration-options)

### Something's not working. Where can I get help?

1. **Check our troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and solutions are documented in [Troubleshooting](/usage/troubleshooting/troubleshooting)
2. **Search existing issues**: Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) to see if others have encountered the same problem
3. **Join our community**: Get help from other users and developers:
   - [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/openhands-ai/shared_invite/zt-34zm4j0gj-Qz5kRHoca8DFCbqXPS~f_A)
   - [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ESHStjSjD4)
4. **Report bugs**: If you've found a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/new) with details about your setup and the problem

### Can I use OpenHands for production workloads?

OpenHands is actively developed and used by many teams, but consider these factors for production use:

- **Security**: Review our [security considerations](/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation) for production deployments
- **Reliability**: Test thoroughly with your specific use cases
- **Monitoring**: Implement appropriate logging and monitoring
- **Rate limits**: Be aware of LLM provider rate limits and costs
- **Backup**: Ensure important work is backed up and version controlled

For production deployments, consider using [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev) for managed infrastructure and support.
