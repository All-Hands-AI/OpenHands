### Start the App

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.42-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.42-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.42
```

You'll find OpenHands running at http://localhost:3000!

### Setup

After launching OpenHands, you **must** select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` and enter a corresponding `API Key`.
This can be done during the initial settings popup or by selecting the `Settings`
button (gear icon) in the UI.

If the required model does not exist in the list, in `Settings` under the `LLM` tab, you can toggle `Advanced` options
and manually enter it with the correct prefix in the `Custom Model` text box.
The `Advanced` options also allow you to specify a `Base URL` if required.

#### Getting an API Key

OpenHands requires an API key to access most language models. Here's how to get an API key from the recommended providers:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Google (Gemini)">

Consider setting usage limits to control costs.

#### Setting Up Search Engine

OpenHands can be configured to use a search engine to allow the agent to search the web for information when needed.

To enable search functionality in OpenHands:

1. Get a Tavily API key from [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/).
2. Enter the Tavily API key in the Settings page under `LLM` tab > `Search API Key (Tavily)`

For more details, see the [Search Engine Setup](/usage/search-engine-setup) guide.

Now you're ready to [get started with OpenHands](/usage/getting-started).

### Versions

The [docker command above](/usage/local-setup#start-the-app) pulls the most recent stable release of OpenHands. You have other options as well:
- For a specific release, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with the version number.
For example, `0.9` will automatically point to the latest `0.9.x` release, and `0` will point to the latest `0.x.x` release.
- For the most up-to-date development version, replace `$VERSION` in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with `main`.
This version is unstable and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.
