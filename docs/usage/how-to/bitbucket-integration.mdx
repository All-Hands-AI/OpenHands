title: Bitbucket Integration (Local)
description: This guide walks you through setting up Bitbucket integration when running OpenHands locally.
---

## Prerequisites

- OpenHands running locally (see [Local Setup](/usage/local-setup))
- A Bitbucket account with access to the repositories you want to work with

## Setting Up Bitbucket Integration

### 1. Create a Bitbucket App Password

To integrate OpenHands with Bitbucket, you'll need to create an app password:

1. Visit [Bitbucket's app passwords settings](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
2. Click "Create app password"
3. Give your app password a descriptive name (e.g., "OpenHands Integration")
4. Select the following scopes:

<Accordion title="Required Bitbucket App Password Scopes">
  - **Repositories: Read** - Allows OpenHands to read repository content
  - **Repositories: Write** - Allows OpenHands to make changes to repositories
  - **Pull requests: Read** - Allows OpenHands to read pull request information
  - **Pull requests: Write** - Allows OpenHands to create and update pull requests
  - **Issues: Read** - Allows OpenHands to read issue information
  - **Issues: Write** - Allows OpenHands to create and update issues
</Accordion>

5. Click "Create" and copy the generated app password

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables for Bitbucket integration:

```bash
# Bitbucket credentials
export BITBUCKET_TOKEN="your-bitbucket-app-password"
export GIT_USERNAME="your-bitbucket-username"  # Optional, defaults to token owner
```

### 3. Using OpenHands with Bitbucket Repositories

Once configured, you can use OpenHands with your Bitbucket repositories in several ways:

#### CLI Mode
When using [CLI mode](/usage/how-to/cli-mode), OpenHands will automatically use your Bitbucket credentials when working with Bitbucket repositories.

#### Headless Mode
For [headless mode](/usage/how-to/headless-mode), ensure your environment variables are set before running OpenHands.

#### Issue Resolution
You can use the OpenHands resolver to automatically work on Bitbucket issues:

```bash
python -m openhands.resolver.resolve_issue --selected-repo [OWNER]/[REPO] --issue-number [NUMBER]
```

For example:
```bash
python -m openhands.resolver.resolve_issue --selected-repo mycompany/myproject --issue-number 42
```

## Security Considerations

- Store your Bitbucket app password securely and never commit it to version control
- Consider using environment variable files (`.env`) that are excluded from version control
- Regularly rotate your app passwords for enhanced security
- Only grant the minimum required scopes for your use case

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your app password is correct and hasn't expired
- Ensure all required scopes are granted to your app password
- Check that your username is correct if specified

### Repository Access Issues
- Confirm you have the necessary permissions on the Bitbucket repository
- Verify the repository URL format is correct (`owner/repo`)

### Need Help?
If you encounter issues with Bitbucket integration, please:
- Check the [troubleshooting guide](/usage/troubleshooting/troubleshooting)
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/all-hands-ai/openhands/issues) on the OpenHands repository
- Contact us at [contact@all-hands.dev](mailto:contact@all-hands.dev)

## Next Steps

- Learn about [CLI mode](/usage/how-to/cli-mode) for interactive development
- Explore [headless mode](/usage/how-to/headless-mode) for automated workflows
- Set up [repository microagents](/usage/prompting/microagents-repo) for custom instructions
