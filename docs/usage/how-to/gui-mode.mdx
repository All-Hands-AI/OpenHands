## Prerequisites

- [OpenHands is running](/usage/local-setup)

## Overview

### Initial Setup

1. Upon first launch, you'll see a settings popup.
2. Select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` from the dropdown menus. If the required model does not exist in the list,
   select `see advanced settings`. Then toggle `Advanced` options and enter it with the correct prefix in the
   `Custom Model` text box.
3. Enter the corresponding `API Key` for your chosen provider.
4. Click `Save Changes` to apply the settings.

### Settings

You can use the Settings page at any time to:

- Setup the LLM provider and model for OpenHands.
- [Setup the search engine](/usage/search-engine-setup).
- [Configure MCP servers](/usage/mcp).
- [Connect to GitHub](/usage/how-to/gui-mode#github-setup) and [connect to GitLab](/usage/how-to/gui-mode#gitlab-setup)
- Set application settings like your preferred language, notifications and other preferences.
- Generate custom secrets.

#### GitHub Setup

OpenHands automatically exports a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the shell environment if provided:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Setting Up a GitHub Token">

  1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - On GitHub, go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic).
   - **New token (classic)**
     - Required scopes:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - **Fine-Grained Tokens**
     - All Repositories (You can select specific repositories, but this will impact what returns in repo search)
     - Minimal Permissions (Select `Meta Data = Read-only` read for search, `Pull Requests = Read and Write` and `Content = Read and Write` for branch creation)
  2. **Enter Token in OpenHands**:
   - In the Settings page, navigate to the `Git` tab.
   - Paste your token in the `GitHub Token` field.
   - Click `Save Changes` to apply the changes.

  If you're working with organizational repositories, additional setup may be required:

  1. **Check Organization Requirements**:
   - Organization admins may enforce specific token policies.
   - Some organizations require tokens to be created with SSO enabled.
   - Review your organization's [token policy settings](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization).
  2. **Verify Organization Access**:
   - Go to your token settings on GitHub.
   - Look for the organization under `Organization access`.
   - If required, click `Enable SSO` next to your organization.
   - Complete the SSO authorization process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
  Common issues and solutions:

  - **Token Not Recognized**:
     - Check that the token hasn't expired.
     - Verify the token has the required scopes.
     - Try regenerating the token.

  - **Organization Access Denied**:
     - Check if SSO is required but not enabled.
     - Verify organization membership.
     - Contact organization admin if token policies are blocking access.

  - **Verifying Token Works**:
     - The app will show a green checkmark if the token is valid.
     - Try accessing a repository to confirm permissions.
     - Check the browser console for any error messages.
