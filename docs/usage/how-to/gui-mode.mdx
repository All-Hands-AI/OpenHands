## Prerequisites

- [OpenHands is running](/usage/local-setup)

## Launching the GUI Server

### Using the CLI Command

You can launch the OpenHands GUI server directly from the command line using the `serve` command:

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisites**: You need to have the [OpenHands CLI installed](/usage/how-to/cli-mode) first, OR have `uv` installed and run `uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands serve`. Otherwise, you'll need to use Docker directly (see the [Docker section](#using-docker-directly) below).
</Callout>

```bash
openhands serve
```

This command will:
- Check that Docker is installed and running
- Pull the required Docker images
- Launch the OpenHands GUI server at http://localhost:3000
- Use the same configuration directory (`~/.openhands`) as the CLI mode

#### Mounting Your Current Directory

To mount your current working directory into the GUI server container, use the `--mount-cwd` flag:

```bash
openhands serve --mount-cwd
```

This is useful when you want to work on files in your current directory through the GUI. The directory will be mounted at `/workspace` inside the container.

#### Using GPU Support

If you have NVIDIA GPUs and want to make them available to the OpenHands container, use the `--gpu` flag:

```bash
openhands serve --gpu
```

This will enable GPU support via nvidia-docker, mounting all available GPUs into the container. You can combine this with other flags:

```bash
openhands serve --gpu --mount-cwd
```

**Prerequisites for GPU support:**
- NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed on your host system
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker2)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) must be installed and configured

#### Requirements

Before using the `openhands serve` command, ensure that:
- Docker is installed and running on your system
- You have internet access to pull the required Docker images
- Port 3000 is available on your system

The CLI will automatically check these requirements and provide helpful error messages if anything is missing.

### Using Docker Directly

Alternatively, you can run the GUI server using Docker directly. See the [local setup guide](/usage/local-setup) for detailed Docker instructions.

## Overview

### Initial Setup

1. Upon first launch, you'll see a settings popup.
2. Select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` from the dropdown menus. If the required model does not exist in the list,
   select `see advanced settings`. Then toggle `Advanced` options and enter it with the correct prefix in the
   `Custom Model` text box.
3. Enter the corresponding `API Key` for your chosen provider.
4. Click `Save Changes` to apply the settings.

### Settings

You can use the Settings page at any time to:

- Setup the LLM provider and model for OpenHands.
- [Setup the search engine](/usage/search-engine-setup).
- [Configure MCP servers](/usage/mcp).
- [Connect to GitHub](/usage/how-to/gui-mode#github-setup), [connect to GitLab](/usage/how-to/gui-mode#gitlab-setup)
  and [connect to Bitbucket](/usage/how-to/gui-mode#bitbucket-setup).
- Set application settings like your preferred language, notifications and other preferences.
- [Manage custom secrets](/usage/common-settings#secrets-management).

#### GitHub Setup

OpenHands automatically exports a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the shell environment if provided:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Setting Up a GitHub Token">

  1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - On GitHub, go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic).
   - **New token (classic)**
     - Required scopes:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - **Fine-Grained Tokens**
     - All Repositories (You can select specific repositories, but this will impact what returns in repo search)
     - Minimal Permissions (Select `Meta Data = Read-only` read for search, `Pull Requests = Read and Write` and `Content = Read and Write` for branch creation)
  2. **Enter Token in OpenHands**:
   - In the Settings page, navigate to the `Integrations` tab.
   - Paste your token in the `GitHub Token` field.
   - Click `Save Changes` to apply the changes.

  If you're working with organizational repositories, additional setup may be required:

  1. **Check Organization Requirements**:
   - Organization admins may enforce specific token policies.
   - Some organizations require tokens to be created with SSO enabled.
   - Review your organization's [token policy settings](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization).
  2. **Verify Organization Access**:
   - Go to your token settings on GitHub.
   - Look for the organization under `Organization access`.
   - If required, click `Enable SSO` next to your organization.
   - Complete the SSO authorization process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
  Common issues and solutions:

  - **Token Not Recognized**:
     - Check that the token hasn't expired.
     - Verify the token has the required scopes.
     - Try regenerating the token.

  - **Organization Access Denied**:
     - Check if SSO is required but not enabled.
     - Verify organization membership.
     - Contact organization admin if token policies are blocking access.

  - **Verifying Token Works**:
     - The app will show a green checkmark if the token is valid.
     - Try accessing a repository to confirm permissions.
     - Check the browser console for any error messages.

### Key Features

For an overview of the key features available inside a conversation, please refer to the [Key Features](/usage/key-features)
section of the documentation.

### Status Indicator

The status indicator located in the bottom left of the screen will cycle through a number of states as a new conversation
is loaded. Typically these include:

* `Disconnected` : The frontend is not connected to any conversation.
* `Connecting` : The frontend is connecting a websocket to a conversation.
* `Building Runtime...` : The server is building a runtime. This is typically in development mode only while building a docker image.
* `Starting Runtime...` : The server is starting a new runtime instance - probably a new docker container or remote runtime.
* `Initializing Agent...` : The server is starting the agent loop (This step does not appear at present with Nested runtimes).
* `Setting up workspace...` : Usually this means a `git clone ...` operation.
* `Setting up git hooks` : Setting up the git pre commit hooks for the workspace.
* `Agent is awaiting user input...` : Ready to go!
