# 🙌 Contributing to OpenHands

Welcome to the OpenHands community! We're building the future of AI-powered software development, and we'd love for you to be part of this journey.

## 🌟 Our Vision: Free as in Freedom

The OpenHands community is built around the belief that **AI and AI agents are going to fundamentally change the way we build software**, and if this is true, we should do everything we can to make sure that the benefits provided by such powerful technology are **accessible to everyone**.

We believe in the power of open source to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technology. Just as the internet transformed how we share information, we envision a world where AI-powered development tools are available to every developer, regardless of their background or resources.

If this resonates with you, we'd love to have you join us in our quest! 🚀
