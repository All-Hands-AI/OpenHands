# Confirmation Mode and Security Analyzers

OpenHands provides a security framework to help protect users from potentially risky actions through **Confirmation Mode** and **Security Analyzers**. This system analyzes agent actions and prompts users for confirmation when high-risk operations are detected.

## Overview

The security system consists of two main components:

1. **Confirmation Mode**: When enabled, the agent will pause and ask for user confirmation before executing actions that are flagged as high-risk by the security analyzer.

2. **Security Analyzers**: These are modules that evaluate the risk level of agent actions and determine whether user confirmation is required.

## Configuration

### CLI
In CLI mode, confirmation is enabled by default. The system uses the LLM Analyzer and will automatically confirm LOW and MEDIUM risk actions, only prompting for HIGH risk actions. You can choose different confirmation modes when prompted.

### GUI
You can configure the security system in the **LLM Settings (Advanced)** tab:

- **Enable Confirmation Mode**: Toggle this to enable/disable the confirmation system
- **Security Analyzer**: Choose which analyzer to use for risk assessment

## Security Analyzers

OpenHands includes multiple analyzers:

- **LLM Risk Analyzer** (default): Uses the same LLM as the agent to assess action risk levels
- **Invariant Analyzer**: Uses Invariant Labs' policy engine to evaluate action traces against security policies

### LLM Risk Analyzer
The default analyzer that leverages the agent's LLM to evaluate the security risk of each action. It considers the action type, parameters, and context to assign risk levels.

### Invariant Analyzer
An advanced analyzer that:
- Collects conversation events and parses them into a trace
- Checks the trace against an Invariant policy to classify risk (low, medium, high)
- Manages an Invariant server container automatically if needed
- Supports optional browsing-alignment and harmful-content checks

## How It Works

1. **Action Analysis**: When the agent wants to perform an action, the selected security analyzer evaluates its risk level.

2. **Risk Assessment**: The analyzer returns one of three risk levels:
   - **LOW**: Action proceeds without confirmation
   - **MEDIUM**: Action proceeds without confirmation (may be configurable in future)
   - **HIGH**: Action is paused, and user confirmation is requested

3. **User Confirmation**: For high-risk actions, a confirmation dialog appears with:
   - Description of the action
   - Risk assessment explanation
   - Options to approve, deny, or modify the action

4. **Action Execution**: Based on user response:
   - **Approve**: Action proceeds as planned
   - **Deny**: Action is cancelled
   - **Modify**: User can edit the action before execution


## Best Practices

### For Most Users
- Use the **LLM Analyzer** (default) for intelligent risk assessment
- Enable **Confirmation Mode** when working with sensitive data or systems
- Review confirmation prompts carefully before approving actions

### For Security-Conscious Users
- Use the **Invariant Analyzer** for advanced policy-based security controls
- Regularly review and understand the actions being performed
- Keep confirmation mode enabled at all times

### For Power Users
- Customize security settings based on your specific use case
- Monitor agent behavior and adjust settings as needed
- Consider using the Invariant Analyzer for advanced security policies in critical environments

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Confirmations
If you're getting too many confirmation prompts:
- The LLM Analyzer (default) provides intelligent filtering of risk levels
- Consider adjusting your confirmation preferences in CLI mode
- Review your security analyzer settings

### Missing Risk Detection
If risky actions aren't being caught:
- Ensure confirmation mode is enabled
- Consider switching to the Invariant Analyzer for more comprehensive coverage
- Check that your security analyzer is properly configured

### Performance Issues
If you experience slow response times:
- Check your LLM configuration and response times (LLM analyzer uses the same LLM as the agent)
- The Invariant Analyzer may have different performance characteristics
- Ensure your LLM provider has good response times

## Security Considerations

- **Trust but Verify**: Even with security analyzers, always review agent actions carefully
- **Context Matters**: Security analyzers may not understand your specific environment or constraints
- **Backup Strategy**: Always maintain backups when allowing agents to modify important data
