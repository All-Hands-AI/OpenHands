## Gemini - Google AI Studio Configs

When running OpenHands, you'll need to set the following in the OpenHands UI through the Settings under the `LLM` tab:
- `LLM Provider` to `Gemini`
- `LLM Model` to the model you will be using.
If the model is not in the list, enable `Advanced` options, and enter it in `Custom Model`
(e.g. gemini/&lt;model-name&gt; like `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash`).
- `API Key` to your Gemini API key

## VertexAI - Google Cloud Platform Configs

To use Vertex AI through Google Cloud Platform when running OpenHands, you'll need to set the following environment
variables using `-e` in the [docker run command](../installation#running-openhands):

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<json-dump-of-gcp-service-account-json>"
VERTEXAI_PROJECT="<your-gcp-project-id>"
VERTEXAI_LOCATION="<your-gcp-location>"
```

Then set the following in the OpenHands UI through the Settings under the `LLM` tab:
- `LLM Provider` to `VertexAI`
- `LLM Model` to the model you will be using.
If the model is not in the list, enable `Advanced` options, and enter it in `Custom Model`
(e.g. vertex_ai/&lt;model-name&gt;).
