## Working on GitLab Issues and Merge Requests Using Openhands

<Note>
This feature works for personal projects and is available for group projects with a
[Premium or Ultimate tier subscription](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/integrations/webhooks/#group-webhooks).
</Note>

Giving GitLab repository access to OpenHands also allows you to work on GitLab issues and merge requests directly.

### Working with Issues

On your repository, label an issue with `openhands` or add a message starting with `@openhands`. OpenHands will:
1. Comment on the issue to let you know it is working on it.
   - You can click on the link to track the progress on OpenHands Cloud.
2. Open a pull request if it determines that the issue has been successfully resolved.
3. Comment on the issue with a summary of the performed tasks and a link to the PR.

### Working with Merge Requests

To get OpenHands to work on merge requests, mention `@openhands` in the comments to:
- Ask questions
- Request updates
- Get code explanations

## Next Steps

- [Learn about the Cloud UI](/usage/cloud/cloud-ui).
- [Use the Cloud API](/usage/cloud/cloud-api) to programmatically interact with OpenHands.
