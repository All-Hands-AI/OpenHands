title: Bitbucket Integration
description: This guide walks you through the process of installing OpenHands Cloud for your Bitbucket repositories. Once set up, it will allow OpenHands to work with your Bitbucket repository.
---

## Prerequisites

- Signed in to [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev) with [a Bitbucket account](/usage/cloud/openhands-cloud).

## Authentication Methods

The Bitbucket integration supports multiple authentication formats:

1. **Username:App Password Format**: If your token contains a colon (`:`) character, it's treated as a username:app_password combination. This is the recommended format for Bitbucket Cloud.
   - Example: `username:app_password` or `user@example.com:app_password`

2. **Access Token Format**: If your token doesn't contain a colon, it's treated as a bearer token.
   - Example: `your_access_token`

## Finding Your Bitbucket Username

To find your Bitbucket username:
1. Log in to Bitbucket
2. Click on your profile avatar in the bottom left corner
3. Your username is displayed in your profile information
4. Alternatively, it's the username in your profile URL: `https://bitbucket.org/username/`

## Repository Structure

Bitbucket repositories follow this structure:
- Workspace/Repository format: `workspace/repo`
- Repository URL: `https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo`
- API URL: `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/workspace/repo`
- Clone URL: `https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo.git`

## Working With Bitbucket Repos in OpenHands Cloud

After signing in with a Bitbucket account, use the `select a repo` and `select a branch` dropdowns to select the
appropriate repository and branch you'd like OpenHands to work on. Then click on `Launch` to start the conversation!

## Using Tokens with Reduced Scopes

By default, OpenHands requests an API-scoped token during OAuth authentication. To restrict the agent's permissions, you can define a custom secret `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, which will override the default token assigned to the agent.

## Creating Pull Requests

When working with Bitbucket repositories, OpenHands can create pull requests using the following parameters:
- Repository name in the format "workspace/repo"
- Source branch name
- Target branch name
- Title of the pull request
- Description of the pull request

## Next Steps

- [Learn about the Cloud UI](/usage/cloud/cloud-ui).
- [Use the Cloud API](/usage/cloud/cloud-api) to programmatically interact with OpenHands.
