   - Repository access for a user is granted based on:
     - Permission granted for the repository
     - User's GitHub permissions (owner/collaborator)
</Accordion>

3. Click `Install & Authorize`.

## Modifying Repository Access

You can modify GitHub repository access at any time by:

## Working on Github Issues and Pull Requests Using Openhands

Giving GitHub repository access to OpenHands also allows you to work on GitHub issues and pull requests directly.

`@openhands`. OpenHands will:
1. Comment on the issue to let you know it is working on it.
   - You can click on the link to track the progress on OpenHands Cloud.
2. Open a pull request if it determines that the issue has been successfully resolved.
3. Comment on the issue with a summary of the performed tasks and a link to the PR.

### Working with Pull Requests

To get OpenHands to work on pull requests, mention `@openhands` in the comments to:
- Ask questions
- Request updates
- Get code explanations
