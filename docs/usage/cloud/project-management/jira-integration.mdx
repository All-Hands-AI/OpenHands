   - Click **Add user**

3. **Configure Account**
   - Locate the created user and click on it
   - Set a secure password
   - Add to relevant Jira projects with appropriate permissions

### Step 2: Generate API Token

1. **Access API Token Management**

   - Go to [API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

2. **Create API Token**
   - Click **Create API token**
   - Label: `OpenHands Cloud Integration`

     - Issue updated

## Workspace Integration

### Step 1: Log in to OpenHands Cloud

1. **Navigate and Authenticate**
   - Go to [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev/)
   - Sign in with your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket)
   - **Important:** Make sure you're signing in with the same Git provider account that contains the repositories you want the OpenHands agent to work on.

### Step 2: Configure Jira Integration

1. **Access Integration Settings**
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**
   - Locate **Jira Cloud** section

2. **Configure Workspace**
   - Click **Configure** button
   - Enter your workspace name and click **Connect**
   - **Important:** Make sure you enter the full workspace name, eg: **yourcompany.atlassian.net**
      - If no integration exists, you'll be prompted to enter additional credentials required for the workspace integration:
         - **Webhook Secret**: The webhook secret from Step 3 above
         - **Service Account Email**: The service account email from Step 1 above
         - **Service Account API Key**: The API token from Step 2 above
         - Ensure **Active** toggle is enabled

3. **Complete OAuth Flow**
   - You'll be redirected to Jira Cloud to complete OAuth verification
   - Grant the necessary permissions to verify your workspace access.
   - If successful, you will be redirected back to the **Integrations** settings in the OpenHands Cloud UI

### Managing Your Integration

**Edit Configuration:**
- Click the **Edit** button next to your configured platform
- Update any necessary credentials or settings
- Click **Update** to apply changes
- You will need to repeat the OAuth flow as before
- **Important:** Only the original user who created the integration can see the edit view

**Unlink Workspace:**
- In the edit view, click **Unlink** next to the workspace name
- This will deactivate your workspace link
- **Important:** If the original user who configured the integration chooses to unlink their integration, any users currently linked to that workspace integration will also be unlinked, and the workspace integration will be deactivated. The integration can only be reactivated by the original user.
