<details>
<summary>Python (with requests)</summary>

```python
import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
url = "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/conversations"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const url = "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/conversations";

const headers = {
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
};

const data = {
  initial_user_msg: "Check whether there is any incorrect information in the README.md file and send a PR to fix it if so.",

async function startConversation() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });

    const conversation = await response.json();

    console.log(`Conversation Link: https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/${conversation.id}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${conversation.status}`);

    return conversation;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error starting conversation:", error);
  }
}

startConversation();
```

</details>

#### Response

The API will return a JSON object with details about the created conversation:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "conversation_id": "abc1234",
}
```

You may receive an `AuthenticationError` if:

- You provided an invalid API key.
- You provided the wrong repository name.
- You don't have access to the repository.


### Retrieving Conversation Status

You can check the status of a conversation by making a GET request to the conversation endpoint.

#### Endpoint

```
GET https://app.all-hands.dev/api/conversations/{conversation_id}
```

#### Example

<details>
<summary>cURL</summary>

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.all-hands.dev/api/conversations/{conversation_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</details>

#### Response

The response is formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "conversation_id":"abc1234",
  "title":"Update README.md",
  "created_at":"2025-04-29T15:13:51.370706Z",
  "last_updated_at":"2025-04-29T15:13:57.199210Z",
  "status":"RUNNING",
  "selected_repository":"yourusername/your-repo",
  "trigger":"gui"
}
```

## Rate Limits

If you have too many conversations running at once, older conversations will be paused to limit the number of concurrent conversations.
If you're running into issues and need a higher limit for your use case, please contact us at [contact@all-hands.dev](mailto:contact@all-hands.dev).
