## Setup

The Cloud Issue Resolver is available automatically when you grant OpenHands Cloud repository access:

## Usage

After granting OpenHands Cloud repository access, you can use the Cloud Issue Resolver on issues and pull requests in your repositories.

### Working with Issues

`@openhands`. OpenHands will:
1. Comment on the issue to let you know it is working on it
   - You can click on the link to track the progress on OpenHands Cloud
2. Open a pull request if it determines that the issue has been successfully resolved
3. Comment on the issue with a summary of the performed tasks and a link to the PR

### Working with Pull Requests

To get OpenHands to work on pull requests, mention `@openhands` in comments to:
- Ask questions
- Request updates
- Get code explanations

OpenHands will:
1. Comment to let you know it is working on it
2. Perform the requested task
