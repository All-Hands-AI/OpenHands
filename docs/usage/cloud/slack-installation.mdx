## Working With the Slack App

To start a new conversation, you can mention `@openhands` in a new message or a thread inside any Slack channel.

Once a conversation is started, all thread messages underneath it will be follow-up messages to OpenHands.

To send follow-up messages for the same conversation, mention `@openhands` in a thread reply to the original message. You must be the user who started the conversation.
