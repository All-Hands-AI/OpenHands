## Working With the Slack App

To start a new conversation, you can mention `@openhands` in a new message or a thread inside any Slack channel.

Once a conversation is started, all thread messages underneath it will be follow-up messages to OpenHands.

To send follow-up messages for the same conversation, mention `@openhands` in a thread reply to the original message. You must be the user who started the conversation.

## Example conversation

### Start a new conversation, and select repo

Conversation is started by mentioning `@openhands`.

Initial request is followed up by mentioning `@openhands` in a thread reply.

## Pro tip

You can mention a repo name when starting a new conversation in the following formats

1. "My-Repo" repo (e.g `@openhands in the openhands repo ...`)
2. "All-Hands-AI/OpenHands" (e.g `@openhands in All-Hands-AI/OpenHands ...`)

The repo match is case insensitive. If a repo name match is made, it will kick off the conversation.
If the repo name partially matches against multiple repos, you'll be asked to select a repo from the filtered list.
