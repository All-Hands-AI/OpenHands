# Project Management Tool Integrations

## Overview

OpenHands Cloud integrates with project management platforms (Jira Cloud, Jira Data Center, and Linear) to enable AI-powered task delegation. Users can invoke the OpenHands agent by:
- Adding `@openhands` in ticket comments
- Adding the `openhands` label to tickets

## Prerequisites

Integration requires two levels of setup:
1. **Platform Configuration** - Administrative setup of service accounts and webhooks on your project management platform (see individual platform documentation below)
2. **Workspace Integration** - Self-service configuration through the OpenHands Cloud UI to link your OpenHands account to the target workspace

### Platform-Specific Setup Guides:
- [Jira Cloud Integration](./jira-integration.md)
- [Jira Data Center Integration](./jira-dc-integration.md)
- [Linear Integration](./linear-integration.md)

## Usage

Once both the platform configuration and workspace integration are completed, users can trigger the OpenHands agent within their project management platforms using two methods:

### Method 1: Comment Mention
Add a comment to any issue with `@openhands` followed by your task description:
```
@openhands Please implement the user authentication feature described in this ticket
```

### Method 2: Label-based Delegation
Add the label `openhands` to any issue. The OpenHands agent will automatically process the issue based on its description and requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### Platform Configuration Issues
- **Webhook not triggering**: Verify the webhook URL is correct and the proper event types are selected (Comment, Issue updated)
- **API authentication failing**: Check API key/token validity and ensure required scopes are granted
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the service account has access to relevant projects/teams and appropriate permissions

### Workspace Integration Issues
- **Workspace linking requests credentials**: If there are no active workspace integrations for the workspace you specified, you need to configure it first. Contact your platform administrator that you want to integrate with (eg: Jira, Linear)
- **OAuth flow fails**: Ensure you're signing in with the same Git provider account that contains the repositories you want OpenHands to work on
- **Integration not found**: Verify the workspace name matches exactly and that platform configuration was completed first

### General Issues
- **Agent not responding**: Check webhook logs in your platform settings and verify service account status
- **Authentication errors**: Verify Git provider permissions and OpenHands Cloud access
- **Partial functionality**: Ensure both platform configuration and workspace integration are properly completed

### Getting Help
For additional support, contact OpenHands Cloud support with:
- Your integration platform (Linear, Jira Cloud, or Jira Data Center)
- Workspace name
- Error logs from webhook/integration attempts
- Screenshots of configuration settings (without sensitive credentials)
