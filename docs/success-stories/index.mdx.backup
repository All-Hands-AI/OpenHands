    **@Graham Neubig**: Hi all! Here’s a channel where we can post PRs that were written by OpenHands. Here are some of mine to start out • Writing tests: e.g. for our [memory condenser](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3379) or [agent controller](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3357) • Data analysis: e.g. for [analyzing the number of commits](https://youtu.be/eUn94vTXD5s) to OpenHands by week • Writing de-novo projects: e.g. writing this [PR viewer app](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/commit/3ee726aa3c0fd88beba659e533fb863bccf2dcb4) • Making improvements to existing apps: e.g. [adding a toggle to have dark mode](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/7) or [fixing pagination in API calls](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/4) in the app I just shared

    **@Robert Brennan**: Last week I used OpenHands to quickly get a GitHub action up and running for deploying helm charts! Was nice to be able to iterate directly in the OH UI instead of copy/pasting in and out of Claude/GPT. I didn't try to have it watch the GH Action run in the browser, and respond to failures--that would have made it even better

    **@Robert Brennan**: Wanted to start using Mozilla's SOPS project to manage secrets in IAC, but am not super familiar with it. OpenHands crushed it! Prompts: &gt; please modify the GitHub action to use AWS SOPS to add a secret to Kubernetes. It should add all secrets under k8s/secrets directory &gt; please switch from using AWS for key management to using GCP. Also edit the global terraform inventory to add a key to GCP &gt; please add a 'scripts' directory with 'encrypt.sh' and 'decrypt.sh'. These scripts should take in a file name of an encrypted file. The decrypted file should be stored as 'secrets/decrypted.sh', and be added to gitignore

    **@Robert Brennan**: This one was huge. I identified a bug in OpenHands and diagnosed the problem, but was dreading having to read through a bunch of existing logic to figure out how to solve it. I wrote a very specific prompt describing the issue: &gt; in frontend/src/components/modals/settings/SettingsForm.tsx, there's a variable 'advancedAlreadyInUse' which checks to see if the user's selected model and provider is in the known list of models. But it currently uses basic string matching, which is insufficient. Please look at the logic for 'extractModelAndProvider' and 'organizeModelsAndProviders' (in the utils folder), and write new logic that is more robust OpenHands fixed it in one shot! https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/4038

It seems like it should be able to pretty straightforwardly through the UI, here’s a prompt I provided: '''I'd like to add a new github action that does linting. Please 1. Run a linter on the existing code to make sure it passes (and fix any problems if not) 2. Create a github action that runs the same linter through actions 3. Check out a branch, commit, and send a PR using the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable 4. Use the Github API to check if the github action successfully executes on that PR. If you need to wait some time, you can sleep for a minute or two and check again.''' Maybe this should be another workflow that we could add to our library of workflows?

I finally finished and couldn’t help but share, but I’ll be writing something more detailed up and open-sourcing the code tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face: And if there’s anything you’d like to see, OpenHands takes feature requests :slightly_smiling_face:

    **@Youssef Tourki**: Hello @U07SY5XHQJY I'm intrested in your thoughts about heavily relying on Anthropic. Is there a open LLM alternative that we can run locally and that has decent coding skills ? I feel we are too dependent on Anthropic and once OH or other tools becomes more popular, Anthropic prices might go up, or rate limits go down

So I just asked: '''Please check out the 'feature/add-feature-weights' branch. Then read the pyproject.toml and tests/ to understand how testing works. Run each test one at a time, and measure the memory usage of each test. Before running each test tell me which one you're about to run, and after running the test tell me which one it was and how much memory it used. Finally sort the tests by time and memory consumption.''' OpenHands did this perfectly, and then I could ask it to optimize the slow and high-memory tests, so now I have a snappy test suite.

    **@Graham Neubig**: I was having problems where I wrote a python utility for memory accounting, and the results were not matching top. What would an absolutely bonkers developer do? Yes, download the ancient c source code for top, read through it, and fix the Python implementation so it matched. And yes, that’s what OpenHands did, in about 5 minutes.

    **@Joe O**: OpenHands has written over 50 ESLint rules in the past 3 months for our custom [ESLint plugin repo](https://github.com/BluMintInc/eslint-custom-rules) with little to no manual intervention. At our company, we don’t think people use ESLint rules enough to automate the code review process, so we emphasize using ESLint rules to detect and autocorrect likely bugs, sub-optimally performant code, and sub-optimally extensible code. This has largely freed up our team from having to repeat many nitpicky PR review comments over and over, and increased the efficacy of agents like Cursor Composer that support linting. OpenHands seems to be particularly good at writing ESLint Rules. We think it’s because each ESLint rule is only a couple hundred lines of code, ESLint rules are probably plentiful in the training data of these LLMs, and OpenHands’ success criteria is very well defined: OpenHands can easily test an ESLint rule for correctness with a Jest test suite. Our guess is that other tasks that meet these three criteria are probably well suited for OpenHands too. Big thanks to everyone involved!

    **@Josh Valdez**: this is more of a mixed bag but i think it's interesting and i wanted to share. i attempted to get OpenHands to one shot run tests for the repositories that make up SWE Bench. i forked main for the repos and asked OpenHands with the following prompt to run the tests: run the tests for this repository. figure out how to run the tests and once you've run them, ensure that they have passed in some cases it was able to run the tests in one go. these tended to be repos that were pretty self contained. flask intuitively makes sense. it's a straightforward web server. one amusing thing i noticed was that OpenHands would attempt to test the source code by instead pip install ing the library in test and would in some cases report the tests successfully running, instead of building from source and testing that. likely some of these cases could be fixed with a more thorough initial prompt. here are the results. indicates that OpenHands reported success but that it may have taken a shortcut to get there: • scikit-learn - single shot run tests failed • flask - single shot run tests succeeded • pandas - single shot run tests failed • pytorch - single shot run tests failed • matplotlib - • spaCy - • black - • pytest - • fastapi - • transformers - • django - • numpy -

So the human was like 'it must be that we didn't actually solve it yet' but I prompted without mentioning that. And then the agent got it. It just got it. Alone, it went off and read code and went back and read code, over 200 steps! And then it got it. Clear as day, time saver for sure.

So I asked it: '''I have uploaded /workspace/allhands-stacked.&#123;png,svg&#125; to your workspace. Convert allhands-stacked.svg to a png file, and display both the new png and the old png on a web page. Use your browser to view the two pngs and make sure that the new png looks the same as the old png.''' I love that you can ask it to verify things visually, very nice if you want to check designs.

    **@U06QJHRBLQG**: Oh my, this is super tricky (at least for me). We added a frontend visualization for the 'Microagent activated' event a while ago, but this event never showed up correctly the first time the UI loaded. It only shows up after a page refresh. I scratched my head trying to figure out why for 10+ min and have no clue (because I'm unfamiliar with that part of the codebase). Then i asked OpenHands: and it comes back with a correct fix within 3 minutes... Sometimes OpenHands may feel dumb if you ask it to work on a part of the code you already know super well. But you'd be pleasantly surprised how well it can localize files on parts of repos you have no idea about

    **@Graham Neubig**: Hey @U08QCTDPNSD , sorry about my brief replies before, they're definitely are some integrations with GitHub and gitlab that we do in the open source as well supporting those to azure devops is definitely in line with our general plans. Let me follow up about the details!

    **@Graham Neubig**: I was curious about how well the “DeepWiki” documentation linked on our page worked, so I asked its “deep research” mode a question Then I decided to ask OpenHands the same question. DeepWiki has thought for 5 minutes and not returned an answer yet, and OpenHands has debugged the problem and updated my PR I’m thinking we just need a way to add an “Ask OpenHands” link and we can use that instead of DeepWiki.

    **@Paul Cuciureanu**: I tried both OpenAI Deep Research against a GitHub repo (their new feature) and Gemini (dumped all of openhands' code in there, it's about 500,000 tokens, so it can handle it), and IMO, Gemini reasoned slightly better, and was much faster at helping me make sense of the codebase I think 'Ask OpenHands' would need to be at least as fast and accurate as Gemini for it to be worthwhile(?) Wondering what a *-bench for this use-case might be Might also be an incentive to keep the OpenHands codebase small(er)(?) I think there are 2 use-cases: • discoverability • targeted inquiry There's a bootstrapping challenge, with all the search/prompt paradigm, in not knowing where to begin. So laying it out all like DeepWiki does provides a kind of high-level map to begin to make sense of things. My newbie impression is that DeepWiki feels currently more credible than the user docs, re: [https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c](https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c) - nonetheless, there are additional dimensions to consider here that would help make OpenHands feel more valuable to end-users and developers

    **@Joe Pelletier**: I created a 'code review' microagent that responds to a /codereview trigger keyword. I've tried it on a couple PRs in GitHub and it generally provides very detailed feedback -- that's the success story Unfortunately, the GitHub Resolver forces a summarization before creating a comment on the GitHub PR, which dilutes away all of the detailed feedback. So the user needs to click into the conversation to actually see what the agent provided as code review feedback . Created [#8926](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/8926) for this.

    **@Joe Pelletier**: Prompt '''--- triggers: - /codereview --- PERSONA: You are an expert software engineer and code reviewer with deep experience in modern programming best practices, secure coding, and clean code principles. TASK: Review the code changes in this pull request and provide actionable feedback to help the author improve code quality, maintainability, and security. DO NOT modify the code; only provide specific feedback. CONTEXT: You have full context of the code being committed in the pull request, including the diff, surrounding files, and project structure. The code is written in a modern language and follows typical idioms and patterns for that language. ROLE: As an automated reviewer, your role is to analyze the code changes and produce structured comments, including line numbers, across the following scenarios: CODE REVIEW SCENARIOS: 1. Style and Formatting Check for: - Inconsistent indentation, spacing, or bracket usage - Unused imports or variables - Non-standard naming conventions - Missing or misformatted comments/docstrings - Violations of common language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP8, Google Style Guide) 2. Clarity and Readability Identify: - Overly complex or deeply nested logic - Functions doing too much (violating single responsibility) - Poor naming that obscures intent - Missing inline documentation for non-obvious logic 3. Security and Common Bug Patterns Watch for: - Unsanitized user input (e.g., in SQL, shell, or web contexts) - Hardcoded secrets or credentials - Incorrect use of cryptographic libraries - Common pitfalls (null dereferencing, off-by-one errors, race conditions) INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONSE: Group the feedback by the scenarios above. Then, for each issue you find: - Provide a line number or line range - Briefly explain why it's an issue - Suggest a concrete improvement Use the following structure in your output: [Line 42] :hammer_and_wrench: Unused import: The 'os' module is imported but never used. Remove it to clean up the code. [Lines 78–85] :mag: Readability: This nested if-else block is hard to follow. Consider refactoring into smaller functions or using early returns. [Line 102] :closed_lock_with_key: Security Risk: User input is directly concatenated into an SQL query. This could allow SQL injection. Use parameterized queries instead. REMEMBER, DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE. ONLY PROVIDE FEEDBACK IN YOUR RESPONSE.'''

    **@Ian Walker**: Here's the relevant bit of the conversation, so you can be proud parents! &gt; We're still getting the same error. Let's try one more approach. Let's look at the Lightstreamer documentation to see if there are any other requirements for the subscription request. &gt; MCP Tool Result: tavily_tavily-search &gt; &gt; Let's look at the WebSocket protocol implementation in our code: &gt; Read *[wsok.rs](http://wsok.rs)* &gt; &gt; Let's look at the create_session message: &gt; Read *[create_session.rs](http://create_session.rs)* &gt; &gt; Let's look at the Request macro implementation: &gt; Read *[lib.rs](http://lib.rs)* &gt; &gt; Let's look at the implementation of the Message trait: &gt; Read *[mod.rs](http://mod.rs)* &gt; &gt; Let's look at the implementation of the bind_session message: &gt; Read *[bind_session.rs](http://bind_session.rs)* &gt; &gt; Based on my investigation, I believe the issue might be related to the line endings in the subscription request. Let's modify the [subscription.rs](http://subscription.rs) file to use '\r\n' instead of just '\n' for the control prefix: &gt; Edited *[subscription.rs](http://subscription.rs)* &gt; &gt; Now let's build the project again: &gt; Ran *source '$HOME/.cargo/env' &amp;&amp; cd /workspace/mongoose/monolith &amp;&amp; cargo build -p l...* &gt; &gt; Let's run the ls_test application to see if our changes fixed the issue: &gt; Ran *source '$HOME/.cargo/env' &amp;&amp; cd /workspace/mongoose/monolith &amp;&amp; ...* &gt; Ran *C-c* &gt; &gt; I've successfully fixed the issue with the Lightstreamer subscription request that was causing the server to send a close frame with the error 'Cannot continue due to an unexpected error'.

    **@U08U69PV2LR**: Very simple example, but baby steps.... I am a professor of architecture and urban design. We built, me and some students, an interactive map prototype to help visitors and new students to find important places in the campus. Considering that we lack a lot of knowledge in programming, that was really nice to build and a smooth process. We first created the main components with all-hands and then adjusted some details locally. Definitely, saved us a lot of time and money. That's a prototype but we will have all the info by tuesday. [https://buriti-emau.github.io/Mapa-UFU/](https://buriti-emau.github.io/Mapa-UFU/) Now testing some automated commits.
