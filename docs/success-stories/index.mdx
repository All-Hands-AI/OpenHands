## Data Analysis and Statistics

**Author:** @Graham Neubig
**Posted:** 2024-09-03 14:35:05

Hi all! Here’s a channel where we can post PRs that were written by OpenHands. Here are some of mine to start out

• Writing tests: e.g. for our [memory condenser](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3379) or [agent controller](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3357)
• Data analysis: e.g. for [analyzing the number of commits](https://youtu.be/eUn94vTXD5s) to OpenHands by week
• Writing de-novo projects: e.g. writing this [PR viewer app](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/commit/3ee726aa3c0fd88beba659e533fb863bccf2dcb4)
• Making improvements to existing apps: e.g. [adding a toggle to have dark mode](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/7) or [fixing pagination in API calls](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/4) in the app I just shared


## GitHub Actions and CI/CD Setup

**Author:** @Robert Brennan
**Posted:** 2024-09-03 15:04:10

Last week I used OpenHands to quickly get a GitHub action up and running for deploying helm charts! Was nice to be able to iterate directly in the OH UI instead of copy/pasting in and out of Claude/GPT.

I didn't try to have it watch the GH Action run in the browser, and respond to failures--that would have made it even better


## Educational Tool Development

This one is also an impressive use case of OpenHands from Andrew Ng: [https://t.co/DBIauwXCQv](https://t.co/DBIauwXCQv)
(I actually tried to reproduce the game and ran it locally back then as I was really impressed by his long prompt )


## Documentation Generation

Another use case: generate README for a file/folder by : [https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3576](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3576)


## Secret Management Implementation

**Author:** @Robert Brennan
**Posted:** 2024-09-09 18:19:47

Wanted to start using Mozilla's SOPS project to manage secrets in IAC, but am not super familiar with it. OpenHands crushed it!

Prompts:


## GitHub Actions and CI/CD Setup

**Author:** @Robert Brennan
**Posted:** 2024-09-17 14:53:31

Used OpenHands today to take a repo for a Flask server and:
• add a dockerfile
• add a GitHub action that pushes to a GHCR repo
• creates a tag for every branch
• creates version tags
• add a helm chart for running the server
• including an optional postgres dependency

Took maybe 45 minutes, instead of like half a day wrestling with Claude chat and a terminal


## Container and Deployment Automation

still had to do some manual poking in my terminal e.g. to build the docker file and deploy into a KIND cluster


## Container and Deployment Automation

**Author:** @Robert Brennan

## Debugging with Code Analysis

**Author:** @U06QFDJ1QQ2
**Posted:** 2024-09-22 15:44:58

First time I've seen OpenHands add debug statements to understand what's happening in the code. Pretty cool to see!
Completely fixed the problem


## GitHub Actions and CI/CD Setup

**Author:** @Robert Brennan
**Posted:** 2024-09-23 16:25:09

Another one: was banging my head against my desk trying to figure out an issue with GitHub workflows. While waiting for my latest round of debug statements to kick off, I asked OpenHands to do something entirely different.

It immediately says: "sure, but I noticed a bug with your workflow and I'm going to fix it first". Solved my original problem perfectly

That reminds me of the news where GPT-4o recently seemed to have started talking on user's phones, asking how their day was going - WITHOUT the user initiating the talk


## Single-Attempt Problem Solving

**Author:** @Robert Brennan
**Posted:** 2024-09-24 18:58:25

This one was huge. I identified a bug in OpenHands and diagnosed the problem, but was dreading having to read through a bunch of existing logic to figure out how to solve it.

I wrote a very specific prompt describing the issue:

OpenHands fixed it in one shot! [https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/4038](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/4038)


## Quick Task Completion

**Posted:** 2024-09-27 14:44:21

10:30AM: man I have a meeting in 30m, I really don't have time to pick up an engineering task

10:35AM: maybe I can just give it to OpenHands?

I wanted to have an example flask app that accessed a database, and OpenHands created it with only two prompts

I also learned about the Faker library which is pretty awesome, seems great for tests: [https://pypi.org/project/Faker/](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/)

Hey , you asked whether OpenHands would be able to debug issues with github actions. It seems like it should be able to pretty straightforwardly through the UI, here’s a prompt I provided:

Maybe this should be another workflow that we could add to our library of workflows?

## GitHub Actions and CI/CD Setup

**Author:** @Graham Neubig
**Posted:** 2024-12-02 13:37:10

In terms of a success story, over the weekend I have been using OpenHands to do a variety of serious and not-so-serious things, and I’ve realized it’s really great at polishing PRs so they pass github actions if any workflows are failing. Here is my prompt:


In addition, if I’m doing this specifically for the OpenHands, I sometimes add:

This is super-helpful, because we all know that fixing all the little things that cause CI to fail is a pain.

Used Openhands as a pair programmer to do heavy lifting for a creative/interactive design project in p5js

I usually take around 2 days for high fidelity interactions (planning strategy + writing code + circling back w designer), did this in around 5hrs instead with the designer watching curiously the entire time

**Posted:** 2024-12-04 02:10:00

I’m pretty excited about this one.

I wanted a page where we could monitor the activity of [openhands-agent](https://github.com/openhands-agent), so I asked OpenHands to make one (incrementally of course): [https://openhands-agent-monitor.vercel.app/](https://openhands-agent-monitor.vercel.app/)

100% of the code in this app was written by OpenHands, I didn’t write a single line. The only thing I did manually was set up the vercel deployment configuration.

I finally finished and couldn’t help but share, but I’ll be writing something more detailed up and open-sourcing the code tomorrow

And if there’s anything you’d like to see, OpenHands takes feature requests

Hello   I'm intrested in your thoughts about heavily relying on Anthropic.

Is there a open LLM alternative that we can run locally and that has decent coding skills ? I feel we are too dependent on Anthropic and once OH or other tools becomes more popular, Anthropic prices might go up, or rate limits go down

I'm not sure what other changes we made to browsing lately - except for the new Xingyao's action - but it works great! These days the agent went on to browse github (when I forgot to remind it to use the API), even browse github to see litellm code, when it did not realize it had it locally  , it also went to browse the anthropic site for documentation - great -, fallback to google when it didn't find something - great! It all just worked.

OpenHands did this perfectly, and then I could ask it to optimize the slow and high-memory tests, so now I have a snappy test suite.

Is it me or do folks also get fewer successes when openhands is trying to use the browser? To the extend that I now want to disable the browser-use feature completely. For example, it is much easier for openhands to create a PR using GitHub API than the browser, but somehow openhands keeps trying to use browser first when gh is not installed.

## Writing Tests with OpenHands

**Author:** @Joe O
**Posted:** 2025-02-21 21:20:45

OpenHands has written over 50 ESLint rules in the past 3 months for our custom [ESLint plugin repo](https://github.com/BluMintInc/eslint-custom-rules) with little to no manual intervention. At our company, we don’t think people use ESLint rules enough to automate the code review process, so we emphasize using ESLint rules to detect and autocorrect likely bugs, sub-optimally performant code, and sub-optimally extensible code. This has largely freed up our team from having to repeat many nitpicky PR review comments over and over, and increased the efficacy of agents like Cursor Composer that support linting.

OpenHands seems to be particularly good at writing ESLint Rules. We think it’s because each ESLint rule is only a couple hundred lines of code, ESLint rules are probably plentiful in the training data of these LLMs, and OpenHands’ success criteria is very well defined: OpenHands can easily test an ESLint rule for correctness with a Jest test suite. Our guess is that other tasks that meet these three criteria are probably well suited for OpenHands too.

Big thanks to everyone involved!

## Single-Attempt Problem Solving

**Author:** @Josh Valdez
**Posted:** 2025-02-22 01:59:40

this is more of a mixed bag but i think it's interesting and i wanted to share. i attempted to get OpenHands to one shot run tests for the repositories that make up SWE Bench. i forked main for the repos and asked OpenHands with the following prompt to run the tests: run the tests for this repository. figure out how to run the tests and once you've run them, ensure that they have passed

in some cases it was able to run the tests in one go. these tended to be repos that were pretty self contained. flask intuitively makes sense. it's a straightforward web server.

one amusing thing i noticed was that OpenHands would attempt to test the source code by instead pip installing the library in test and would in some cases report the tests successfully running, instead of building from source and testing that. likely some of these cases could be fixed with a more thorough initial prompt.

here are the results.  indicates that OpenHands reported success but that it may have taken a shortcut to get there:
• scikit-learn - single shot run tests failed
• flask - single shot run tests succeeded
• pandas - single shot run tests failed
• pytorch - single shot run tests failed
• matplotlib -
• spaCy -
• black -
• pytest -
• fastapi -
• transformers -
• django -

I set off openhands on a branch to fix tests. Tests were hanging, not failing plainly, and we had a race condition over the weekend which was solved, but the tests were still hanging in the same point.

So the human was like "it must be that we didn't actually solve it yet" but I prompted without mentioning that.

And then the agent got it. It just got it. Alone, it went off and read code and went back and read code, over 200 steps! And then it got it. Clear as day, time saver for sure.

Interesting story, I asked OpenHands to start an app on port 12000, it showed up on the app pane. I started using the app, and then it crashed… But because it crashed in OpenHands, OpenHands immediately saw the error message and started fixing the problem without me having to do anything. It was already fixing the problem before I even realized what was going wrong

Hello, I am starting to use OpenHands with two teams to analyze the impact it can have. We are currently in the implementation phase, and for this, I created a microagent ([https://github.com/vinisdl/open-hands-azure-devops-microagents](https://github.com/vinisdl/open-hands-azure-devops-microagents)) since we use Azure DevOps for clone repos and open PR.
In the coming months, I will share the results and feedbacks.
Thank you for this wonderful tool!

Wow.. OpenHands really nailed this one for me. It is a 40+ files frontend changes that:
• migrate the trajectory visualizer from ShareOpenHands to our open-source trajectory visualizer
• allow direct upload evaluation output and visualize them
• allow us to sort instances based on certain features (e.g., cost, resolve status, length)
• allow us to show custom stuff in the JSON
All these happen without me looking at the actual code  (I guess now it might be a bit painful to review it  - but i still can't help asking it to add more features)

(and the App tab is working for this one  )

OpenHands is also super helpful for me to figure out OOM issues from vLLM

This issue has bugged me for a while, but I'm too unfamiliar with the vllm codebase and don't really have the patience to go through the code myself -- so I have to live with the pod dying every 15 the minutes, getting restarted, and die again.

I thought maybe i could throw the stack traces and have OpenHands help me figure out stuff -- and it gave me a usable solution in two minutes, and it actually worked!

My first contribution! (hopefully you like it)

Thank you everyone for all the help. I hope this will make you happy as I try to turn from an "OpenHands user" to a "OpenHands community contributor"

Just created an open sourced Github Action and published on Marketplace: "[xinbenlv/openhands-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openhands-ai-action)": This GitHub Action brings the power of OpenHands' AI automation directly into your GitHub workflows. Now you can execute complex tasks using natural language prompts right in your CI/CD pipelines!

Check it out here: [https://github.com/xinbenlv/openhands-action](https://github.com/xinbenlv/openhands-action)

Example usage:
```yaml
- name: Execute OpenHands Task
  uses: xinbenlv/openhands-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Your natural language task description here"
    llm_api_key: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
```

Would love to hear your thoughts and see what creative ways you'll use this in your workflows! Let me know if you have any questions or need help getting started.

Sometimes OpenHands may feel dumb if you ask it to work on a part of the code you already know super well. But you'd be pleasantly surprised how well it can localize files on parts of repos you have no idea about

Then I decided to ask OpenHands the same question.

DeepWiki has thought for 5 minutes and not returned an answer yet, and OpenHands has debugged the problem and updated my PR

I tried both OpenAI Deep Research against a GitHub repo (their new feature) and Gemini (dumped all of openhands' code in there, it's about 500,000 tokens, so it can handle it), and IMO, Gemini reasoned slightly better, and was much faster at helping me make sense of the codebase

I think "Ask OpenHands" would need to be at least as fast and accurate as Gemini for it to be worthwhile(?) Wondering what a *-bench for this use-case might be

Might also be an incentive to keep the OpenHands codebase small(er)(?)

I think there are 2 use-cases:
• discoverability
• targeted inquiry

There's a bootstrapping challenge, with all the search/prompt paradigm, in not knowing where to begin. So laying it out all like DeepWiki does provides a kind of high-level map to begin to make sense of things.

My newbie impression is that DeepWiki feels currently more credible than the user docs, re: [https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c](https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c) - nonetheless, there are additional dimensions to consider here that would help make OpenHands feel more valuable to end-users and developers

Yeah, I think speed is essential for something like this. OpenHands is pretty fast, but we could make it faster by giving it access to code search

I want to share my Coder integration with OpenHands.
This demonstrates running
• Integrating OpenHands with Coder, naturally
• Running OpenHands inside Kubernetes and using Terraform
• Using Docker In Docker (dind), with some minor code change
Full disclosure I did have to fork OpenHands to make a small modification to enable dynamic routing from the Ingress Controller.
Will be happy to submit PR if there's interest.
Please find the Coder setup here [https://github.com/mingfang/coder-templates/blob/master/kubernetes/app-openhands.tf](https://github.com/mingfang/coder-templates/blob/master/kubernetes/app-openhands.tf)

Used OpenHands to launch the queries from the Console using REST API.

Outcome:
Basically, an agent that is running using API. Everything is hosted locally.

Changes required to make that possible:
Adjusting a couple of files e.g. fixing some bugs that crashed the runtime.
Adjusting timeout to cleanup the 'unresponsive' (e.g. without WebSocket connection) containers.

Please refer to CHANGES.md if you want to reproduce the same behavior.

This is mostly undocumented, and some bugs are hidden, because I don't think someone uses /api/conversations  locally.

OpenHands devs, if you read this, could you please take a look at CHANGES.md and ask Claude/Gemini to fix a couple of issues that are explained in the doc?

I created a "code review" microagent that responds to a /codereview trigger keyword. I've tried it on a couple PRs in GitHub and it generally provides very detailed feedback -- that's the success story

Unfortunately, the GitHub Resolver forces a summarization before creating a comment on the GitHub PR, which dilutes away all of the detailed feedback. So the user needs to click into the conversation to actually see what the agent provided as code review feedback . Created [#8926](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/8926) for this.

Very simple example, but baby steps....
I am a professor of architecture and urban design. We built, me and some students, an interactive map prototype to help visitors and new students to find important places in the campus. Considering that we lack a lot of knowledge in programming, that was really nice to build and a smooth process.
We first created the main components with all-hands and then adjusted some details locally. Definitely, saved us a lot of time and money.
That's a prototype but we will have all the info by tuesday.
