<Update label="2025-06-13 Frontline Support" description="@Joe Pelletier">

## One of the cool things about OpenHands, and especially the Slack Integration, is the ability to empower folks who are on the ‘front lines’ with customers.

For example, often times Support and Customer Success teams will field bug reports, doc questions, and other ‘nits’ from customers. They tend to have few options to deal with this, other than file a feedback ticket with product teams and hope it gets prioritized in an upcoming sprint.

Instead, with tools like OpenHands and the Slack integration, they can request OpenHands to make fixes proactively and then have someone on the engineering team (like a lead engineer, a merge engineer, or even technical product manager) review the PR and approve it — thus reducing the cycle time for ‘quick wins’ from weeks to just a few hours.

Here's how we do that with the OpenHands project:

<Update label="2025-06-11 Infra" description="@Xingyao Wang">

## Now, OpenHands does 100% of my infra IAM research for me

Got an IAM error on GCP? Send a screenshot to OH... and it just works!!!
Can't imagine going back to the early days without OH: I'd spend an entire afternoon figuring how to get IAM right

<Update label="2025-06-08 Map" description="@Rodrigo Argenton Freire (ODLab)">

## Very simple example, but baby steps....

I am a professor of architecture and urban design. We built, me and some students, an interactive map prototype to help visitors and new students to find important places in the campus. Considering that we lack a lot of knowledge in programming, that was really nice to build and a smooth process.
We first created the main components with all-hands and then adjusted some details locally. Definitely, saved us a lot of time and money.
That's a prototype but we will have all the info by tuesday.

<Update label="2025-06-05 Paper" description="@Xingyao Wang">

## I asked OpenHands to update my personal website for the "OpenHands Versa" paper.

It is an extremely trivial task: You just need to browse to arxiv, copy the author names, format them for BibTeX, and then modify the papers.bib file. But now I'm getting way too lazy to even open my IDE and actually do this one-file change!
