    **@Graham Neubig**: "Hi all! Here’s a channel where we can post PRs that were written by OpenHands. Here are some of mine to start out

- Writing tests: e.g. for our [memory condenser](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3379) or [agent controller](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3357)
- Data analysis: e.g. for [analyzing the number of commits](https://youtu.be/eUn94vTXD5s) to OpenHands by week
- Writing de-novo projects: e.g. writing this [PR viewer app](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/commit/3ee726aa3c0fd88beba659e533fb863bccf2dcb4)
- Making improvements to existing apps: e.g. [adding a toggle to have dark mode](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/7) or [fixing pagination in API calls](https://github.com/neubig/pr-viewer/pull/4) in the app I just shared"

    **@Robert Brennan**: "Last week I used OpenHands to quickly get a GitHub action up and running for deploying helm charts! Was nice to be able to iterate directly in the OH UI instead of copy/pasting in and out of Claude/GPT.

I didn't try to have it watch the GH Action run in the browser, and respond to failures--that would have made it even better"

- add a dockerfile
- add a GitHub action that pushes to a GHCR repo
- creates a tag for every branch
- creates version tags
- add a helm chart for running the server
- including an optional postgres dependency

Took maybe 45 minutes, instead of like half a day wrestling with Claude chat and a terminal"

I wanted a page where we could monitor the activity of
[openhands-agent](https://github.com/openhands-agent)
, so I asked OpenHands to make one (incrementally of course):
[https://openhands-agent-monitor.vercel.app/](https://openhands-agent-monitor.vercel.app/)

100% of the code in this app was written by OpenHands, I didn’t write a single line. The only thing I did manually was set up the vercel deployment configuration.

I finally finished and couldn’t help but share, but I’ll be writing something more detailed up and open-sourcing the code tomorrow

And if there’s anything you’d like to see, OpenHands takes feature requests"

Is there a open LLM alternative that we can run locally and that has decent coding skills ? I feel we are too dependent on Anthropic and once OH or other tools becomes more popular, Anthropic prices might go up, or rate limits go down"

    **@Graham Neubig**: "Here’s a nice example of something that would have been a pain for me to write, but OpenHands did really well. My test suite was a bit bloated and taking a long time. So I just asked:

OpenHands did this perfectly, and then I could ask it to optimize the slow and high-memory tests, so now I have a snappy test suite."

 with little to no manual intervention. At our company, we don’t think people use ESLint rules enough to automate the code review process, so we emphasize using ESLint rules to detect and autocorrect likely bugs, sub-optimally performant code, and sub-optimally extensible code. This has largely freed up our team from having to repeat many nitpicky PR review comments over and over, and increased the efficacy of agents like Cursor Composer that support linting.

OpenHands seems to be particularly good at writing ESLint Rules. We think it’s because each ESLint rule is only a couple hundred lines of code, ESLint rules are probably plentiful in the training data of these LLMs, and OpenHands’ success criteria is very well defined: OpenHands can easily test an ESLint rule for correctness with a Jest test suite. Our guess is that other tasks that meet these three criteria are probably well suited for OpenHands too.

    **@Josh Valdez**: "this is more of a mixed bag but i think it's interesting and i wanted to share. i attempted to get OpenHands to one shot run tests for the repositories that make up SWE Bench. i forked
main
 for the repos and asked OpenHands with the following prompt to run the tests:
run the tests for this repository. figure out how to run the tests and once you've run them, ensure that they have passed

in some cases it was able to run the tests in one go. these tended to be repos that were pretty self contained.
flask
 intuitively makes sense. it's a straightforward web server.

one amusing thing i noticed was that OpenHands would attempt to test the source code by instead
pip install
ing the library in test and would in some cases report the tests successfully running, instead of building from source and testing that. likely some of these cases could be fixed with a more thorough initial prompt.

here are the results.
 indicates that OpenHands reported success but that it may have taken a shortcut to get there:

- scikit-learn - single shot run tests failed
- flask - single shot run tests succeeded
- pandas - single shot run tests failed
- pytorch - single shot run tests failed
- matplotlib -
- spaCy -
- black -
- pytest -
- fastapi -
- transformers -
- django -

So the human was like "it must be that we didn't actually solve it yet" but I prompted without mentioning that.

And then the agent got it. It just got it. Alone, it went off and read code and went back and read code, over 200 steps! And then it got it. Clear as day, time saver for sure."

- migrate the trajectory visualizer from ShareOpenHands to our open-source trajectory visualizer
- allow direct upload evaluation output and visualize them
- allow us to sort instances based on certain features (e.g., cost, resolve status, length)
- allow us to show custom stuff in the JSON
All these happen without me looking at the actual code
 (I guess now it might be a bit painful to review it
 - but i still can't help asking it to add more features)

Example usage:

```yaml

- name: Execute OpenHands Task

  uses: xinbenlv/openhands-action@v1

  with:

    prompt: "Your natural language task description here"

    llm_api_key: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}

    **@U06QJHRBLQG**: "Oh my, this is super tricky (at least for me).

We added a frontend visualization for the "Microagent activated" event a while ago, but this event never showed up correctly the first time the UI loaded. It only shows up after a page refresh.
I scratched my head trying to figure out why for 10+ min and have no clue (because I'm unfamiliar with that part of the codebase). Then i asked OpenHands:

and it comes back with a correct fix within 3 minutes...

Sometimes OpenHands may feel dumb if you ask it to work on a part of the code you already know super well. But you'd be pleasantly surprised how well it can localize files on parts of repos you have no idea about"

I think "Ask OpenHands" would need to be at least as fast and accurate as Gemini for it to be worthwhile(?) Wondering what a *-bench for this use-case might be

Might also be an incentive to keep the OpenHands codebase small(er)(?)

I think there are 2 use-cases:

- discoverability
- targeted inquiry

There's a bootstrapping challenge, with all the search/prompt paradigm, in not knowing where to begin. So laying it out all like DeepWiki does provides a kind of high-level map to begin to make sense of things.

My newbie impression is that DeepWiki feels currently more credible than the user docs, re:
[https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c](https://medium.com/mytake/the-ux-honeycomb-seven-essential-considerations-for-developers-accc372a398c)

Outcome:
Basically, an agent that is running using API. Everything is hosted locally.

Changes required to make that possible:
Adjusting a couple of files e.g. fixing some bugs that crashed the runtime.
Adjusting timeout to cleanup the 'unresponsive' (e.g. without WebSocket connection) containers.

Please refer to
CHANGES.md
 if you want to reproduce the same behavior.

This is mostly undocumented, and some bugs are hidden, because I don't think someone uses
/api/conversations
  locally.

OpenHands devs, if you read this, could you please take a look at CHANGES.md and ask Claude/Gemini to fix a couple of issues that are explained in the doc?

 trigger keyword. I've tried it on a couple PRs in GitHub and it generally provides very detailed feedback -- that's the success story

Unfortunately, the GitHub Resolver forces a summarization before creating a comment on the GitHub PR, which dilutes away all of the detailed feedback. So the user needs to click into the conversation to actually see what the agent provided as code review feedback

I am a professor of architecture and urban design. We built, me and some students, an interactive map prototype to help visitors and new students to find important places in the campus. Considering that we lack a lot of knowledge in programming, that was really nice to build and a smooth process.
We first created the main components with all-hands and then adjusted some details locally. Definitely, saved us a lot of time and money.
That's a prototype but we will have all the info by tuesday.
