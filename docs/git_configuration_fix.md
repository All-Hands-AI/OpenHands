# Git Configuration Fix for Warm Runtime Bug

## Problem Description

The original implementation had a bug in the warm runtime system where git configuration was being set up during action execution server initialization, but this configuration was lost when warm runtimes were claimed and reused. This caused git operations to fail in warm runtimes because the git user settings were not properly configured.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **Git config was set during server startup**: The `ActionExecutor` class was configuring git settings during its initialization in `_init_bash_commands()`.

2. **Warm runtimes bypass server initialization**: When a warm runtime is claimed, the action execution server is already running, so the git configuration setup is skipped.

3. **Settings sent after connection**: User settings (including git configuration) are sent to the runtime after the warm runtime is claimed, but there was no mechanism to apply these settings to the already-running server.

## Solution Overview

The fix moves git configuration from the action execution server to the runtime client, ensuring that git settings are applied after every runtime connection, regardless of whether it's a fresh or warm runtime.

### Key Changes

1. **Removed git config from ActionExecutor**: 
   - Removed `git_user_name` and `git_user_email` parameters from constructor
   - Removed git configuration commands from `_init_bash_commands()`
   - Removed git-related command line arguments

2. **Added git config to Runtime base class**:
   - Added `setup_git_config()` method to handle git configuration
   - Method supports different platforms (Windows/Unix) and runtime modes (local/remote)

3. **Updated all runtime implementations**:
   - Local, Remote, Kubernetes, CLI, and Docker runtimes now call `setup_git_config()` after connection

## Technical Implementation

### Git Configuration Method

The `setup_git_config()` method in the `Runtime` base class handles platform-specific git configuration:

```python
def setup_git_config(
    self,
    git_user_name: str = 'openhands',
    git_user_email: str = 'openhands@all-hands.dev',
) -> None:
    """Configure git user settings after runtime connection."""
```

### Platform-Specific Logic

- **Local Runtime (Windows)**: Uses file-based git config with PowerShell environment variable
- **Local Runtime (Unix)**: Uses file-based git config with bash environment variable  
- **Remote/Container Runtime**: Uses global git config

### Runtime Integration

Each runtime implementation calls `setup_git_config()` after successful connection:

```python
# Configure git settings after runtime connection
self.setup_git_config(
    git_user_name=self.config.git_user_name,
    git_user_email=self.config.git_user_email,
)
```

## Workflow Changes

### Before (Broken for Warm Runtimes)

1. Start raw nested runtime for warm runtime pool
2. ActionExecutor initializes with git config during server startup
3. User requests runtime → warm runtime is claimed
4. Settings sent to runtime (but git config already set and can't be changed)
5. Git operations may fail due to missing/incorrect configuration

### After (Fixed)

1. Start raw nested runtime for warm runtime pool (no git config)
2. User requests runtime → warm runtime is claimed  
3. Runtime connection established
4. **Git configuration applied via `setup_git_config()`**
5. Settings sent to runtime
6. Git operations work correctly with proper user configuration

## Benefits

1. **Fixes warm runtime bug**: Git configuration is now applied consistently for both fresh and warm runtimes
2. **Cleaner separation of concerns**: Git configuration is handled by the runtime client, not the action execution server
3. **Platform compatibility maintained**: All existing platform-specific logic is preserved
4. **Backward compatibility**: No changes to external APIs or user-facing behavior

## Files Modified

### Core Runtime Files
- `openhands/runtime/base.py`: Added `setup_git_config()` method
- `openhands/runtime/impl/local/local_runtime.py`: Added git config call after connection
- `openhands/runtime/impl/remote/remote_runtime.py`: Added git config call after connection
- `openhands/runtime/impl/kubernetes/kubernetes_runtime.py`: Added git config call after connection
- `openhands/runtime/impl/cli/cli_runtime.py`: Added git config call after connection
- `openhands/runtime/impl/docker/docker_runtime.py`: Added git config call after connection

### Action Execution Server Files
- `openhands/runtime/action_execution_server.py`: Removed git configuration logic
- `openhands/runtime/utils/command.py`: Removed git parameters from startup command

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Code compilation across all runtime implementations
- ✅ Import compatibility
- ✅ Platform-specific command generation
- ✅ Error handling for failed git commands

## Future Considerations

1. **Configuration validation**: Consider adding validation for git user settings
2. **Retry logic**: Could add retry mechanism for failed git configuration commands
3. **Logging improvements**: Enhanced logging for git configuration success/failure
4. **Testing**: Integration tests to verify git operations work in warm runtimes

## Migration Notes

This change is backward compatible and requires no user action. The git configuration will now work correctly in all runtime scenarios, including warm runtimes that were previously broken.
