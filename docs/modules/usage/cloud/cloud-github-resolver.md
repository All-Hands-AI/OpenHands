# Cloud GitHub Resolver

The GitHub Resolver automates code fixes and provides intelligent assistance for your repositories.

## Setup

The Cloud GitHub Resolver is available automatically when you

## Usage

After granting OpenHands Cloud repository access, you can use the Cloud GitHub Resolver on the issues and pull requests

On your repository, label an issue with `openhands`. OpenHands will:
1. Comment on the issue to let you know it is working on it.
    - You can click on the link to track the progress on OpenHands Cloud.
2. Open a pull request if it determines that the issue has been successfully resolved.
3. Comment on the issue with a summary of the performed tasks and a link to the pull request.
