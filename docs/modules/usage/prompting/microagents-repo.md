# General Repository Microagents

## Overview

General guidelines for OpenHands to work more effectively with the repository.

### General Repository Microagent

It is recommended to create a general repository microagent (example: `.openhands/microagents/repo.md`) to include 
project-specific instructions, team practices, coding standards, and architectural guidelines that are relevant for 
**all** prompts in that repository.

[See the repo microagent in the official OpenHands repository as an example](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/.openhands/microagents/repo.md?plain=1)
