# Micro-Agents Overview

OpenHands uses specialized micro-agents to handle specific tasks and contexts efficiently. These micro-agents are small,
focused components that provide specialized behavior and knowledge for particular scenarios.

## Micro-Agent Types

Currently OpenHands supports the following types of Micro-Agents:

* [Public Micro-Agents](./microagents-public): Universal guidelines integrated into OpenHands.
* [Repository Micro-Agents](./microagents-repo): Repository-specific context and guidelines for OpenHands.
