# Getting Started

## System Requirements

* Docker version 26.0.0+ or Docker Desktop 4.31.0+
* You must be using Linux or Mac OS
  * If you are on Windows, you must use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Installation

The easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker. You can change `WORKSPACE_BASE` below to point OpenHands to
existing code that you'd like to modify.

```bash
export WORKSPACE_BASE=$(pwd)/workspace

docker run -it --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.9-nikolaik \
    -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
    -e WORKSPACE_MOUNT_PATH=$WORKSPACE_BASE \
    -v $WORKSPACE_BASE:/opt/workspace_base \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
    ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.9
```

You can also run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
or as an [interactive CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode).

## Setup

After running the command above, you'll find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The agent will have access to the `./workspace` folder to do its work. You can copy existing code here, or change `WORKSPACE_BASE` in the
command to point to an existing folder.

Upon launching OpenHands, you'll see a settings modal. You **must** select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` and enter a corresponding `API Key`.
These can be changed at any time by selecting the `Settings` button (gear icon) in the UI.

If the required `LLM Model` does not exist in the list, you can toggle `Advanced Options` and manually enter it with the correct prefix
in the `Custom Model` text box.
The `Advanced Options` also allow you to specify a `Base URL` if required.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '20px' }}>
  <img src="/img/settings-screenshot.png" alt="settings-modal" width="340" />
  <img src="/img/settings-advanced.png" alt="settings-modal" width="335" />
</div>

## Versions

The command above pulls the `0.9` tag, which represents the most recent stable release of OpenHands. You have other options as well:
- For a specific release, use `ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/openhands:$VERSION`, replacing $VERSION with the version number.
- We use semver, and release major, minor, and patch tags. So `0.9` will automatically point to the latest `0.9.x` release, and `0` will point to the latest `0.x.x` release.
- For the most up-to-date development version, you can use `ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/openhands:main`. This version is unstable and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.

You can choose the tag that best suits your needs based on stability requirements and desired features.
