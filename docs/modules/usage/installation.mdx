## Start the App

The easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker.

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.26-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.26-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.26
```

You'll find OpenHands running at http://localhost:3000!

You can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes#connecting-to-your-filesystem),
run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),
or run it on tagged issues with [a github action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).

## Setup

Upon launching OpenHands, you'll see a Settings page. You **must** select an `LLM Provider` and `LLM Model` and enter a corresponding `API Key`.
These can be changed at any time by selecting the `Settings` button (gear icon) in the UI.

If the required model does not exist in the list, you can toggle `Advanced` options and manually enter it with the correct prefix
in the `Custom Model` text box.
The `Advanced` options also allow you to specify a `Base URL` if required.

Now you're ready to [get started with OpenHands](./getting-started).

## Versions

The [docker command above](./installation#start-the-app) pulls the most recent stable release of OpenHands. You have other options as well:
- For a specific release, replace $VERSION in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with the version number.
We use SemVer so `0.9` will automatically point to the latest `0.9.x` release, and `0` will point to the latest `0.x.x` release.
- For the most up-to-date development version, replace $VERSION in `openhands:$VERSION` and `runtime:$VERSION`, with `main`.
This version is unstable and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.

You can choose the tag that best suits your needs based on stability requirements and desired features.

For the development workflow, see [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).
