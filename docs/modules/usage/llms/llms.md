# ðŸ¤– LLM Backends

OpenHands can connect to any LLM supported by LiteLLM. However, it requires a powerful model to work.
The following are verified by the community to work with OpenHands:
* claude-3-5-sonnet
* gemini-1.5-pro / gemini-1.5-flash
* gpt-4 / gpt-4o
* llama-3.1-405b / hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b
* wizardlm-2-8x22b

If you have successfully run OpenHands with specific LLMs not in the list, please add them to the verified list. We
also encourage you to open a PR to share your setup process to help others using the same provider and LLM!

For a full list of the providers and models available, please consult the
[litellm documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

## Local and Open Source Models
Most current local and open source models are not as powerful. When using such models, you may see long
wait times between messages, poor responses, or errors about malformed JSON. OpenHands can only be as powerful as the
models driving it. However, if you do find ones that work, please add them to the verified list above.

## LLM Configuration
:::warning
OpenHands will issue many prompts to the LLM you configure. Most of these LLMs cost money, so be sure to set spending
limits and monitor usage.
:::

The `LLM_MODEL` environment variable controls which model is used in programmatic interactions.
But when using the OpenHands UI, you'll need to choose your model in the settings window.

The following environment variables might be necessary for some LLMs/providers:

- `LLM_API_KEY`
- `LLM_BASE_URL`
- `LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
- `LLM_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
- `LLM_API_VERSION`
- `LLM_DROP_PARAMS`

We have a few guides for running OpenHands with specific model providers:

- [OpenAI](llms/openai-llms)
- [ollama](llms/local-llms)
- [Azure](llms/azure-llms)
- [Google](llms/google-llms)

### API retries and rate limits

Some LLMs have rate limits and may require retries. OpenHands will automatically retry requests if it receives a 429 error or API connection error.
You can set the following environment variables to control the number of retries and the time between retries:
* `LLM_NUM_RETRIES` (Default of 5)
* `LLM_RETRY_MIN_WAIT` (Default of 3 seconds)
* `LLM_RETRY_MAX_WAIT` (Default of 60 seconds)
