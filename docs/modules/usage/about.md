## ‚≠êÔ∏è Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is complex. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focus on foundational research to improve code generation and handling.
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhance core components through data curation and improved training methods.
3. **Task Planning:** Develop capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization.
4. **Evaluation:** Establish comprehensive metrics to better understand and improve our models.

## üöß Default Agent

Our default Agent is currently the CodeActAgent, capable of generating code and handling files. We're working on other Agent implementations, including [SWE Agent](https://swe-agent.com/). [Read about our current set of agents here](./agents).

## ü§ù How to Contribute

OpenDevin welcomes contributions from everyone:

- **Code Contributions:** Develop core functionalities, frontend interface, or sandboxing solutions.
- **Research and Evaluation:** Contribute to understanding LLMs in software engineering, evaluate models, or suggest improvements.
- **Feedback and Testing:** Use OpenDevin, report bugs, suggest features, or provide usability feedback.
