# About OpenHands

## Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models

## Default Agent

Our default Agent is currently the [CodeActAgent](agents), which is capable of generating code and handling files.

## Built With

OpenHands is built using a combination of powerful frameworks and libraries, providing a robust foundation for its development. Here are the key technologies used in the project:
