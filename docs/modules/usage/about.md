## ⭐️ Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models

## 🚧 Default Agent

Our default Agent is currently the [CodeActAgent](agents), which is capable of generating code and handling files.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

OpenHands is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing the field of software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:
