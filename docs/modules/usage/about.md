## ‚≠êÔ∏è Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling.
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more.
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization.
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models.

## üöß Default Agent

- Our default Agent is currently the MonologueAgent, which has limited capabilities, but is fairly stable. We're working on other Agent implementations, including [SWE Agent](https://swe-agent.com/). You can [read about our current set of agents here](./agents).

## ü§ù How to Contribute

OpenDevin is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing the field of software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:

- **Code Contributions:** Help us develop the core functionalities, frontend interface, or sandboxing solutions.
- **Research and Evaluation:** Contribute to our understanding of LLMs in software engineering, participate in evaluating the models, or suggest improvements.
- **Feedback and Testing:** Use the OpenDevin toolset, report bugs, suggest features, or provide feedback on usability.
