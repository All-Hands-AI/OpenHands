# Using the OpenHands GitHub Action

This guide explains how to use the OpenHands GitHub Action, both within the OpenHands repository and in your own projects.

## Using the Action in the OpenHands Repository

To use the OpenHands GitHub Action in the OpenHands repository, an OpenHands maintainer can:

1. Create an issue in the repository.
2. Add the `fix-me` label to the issue.
3. The action will automatically trigger and attempt to resolve the issue.

## Installing the Action in a New Repository

To install the OpenHands GitHub Action in your own repository, follow
the [README for the OpenHands Resolver](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/openhands/resolver/README.md).
