# Using the OpenHands GitHub Action

This guide explains how to use the OpenHands GitHub Action, both within the OpenHands repository and in your own projects.

## Using the Action in the OpenHands Repository

To use the OpenHands GitHub Action in the OpenHands repository, an OpenHands maintainer can:

1. Create an issue in the repository.
2. Add the `fix-me` label to the issue.
3. The action will automatically trigger and attempt to resolve the issue.

## Installing the Action in a New Repository

To install the OpenHands GitHub Action in your own repository, follow the [directions in the OpenHands Resolver repo](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands-resolver?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-github-actions-workflow).
