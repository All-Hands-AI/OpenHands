# CLI Mode

OpenHands can be run in an interactive CLI mode, which allows users to start an interactive session via the command line.

This mode is different from the [headless mode](headless-mode), which is non-interactive and better for scripting.

## With Python

To start an interactive OpenHands session via the command line, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have followed the [Development setup instructions](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).

2. Run the following command:

```bash
poetry run python -m openhands.core.cli
```

This command will start an interactive session where you can input tasks and receive responses from OpenHands.

You'll need to be sure to set your model, API key, and other settings via environment variables
[or the `config.toml` file](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/config.template.toml).


## With Docker

To run OpenHands in CLI mode with Docker, follow these steps:

1. Set `WORKSPACE_BASE` to the directory you want OpenHands to edit:

```bash
WORKSPACE_BASE=$(pwd)/workspace
```

2. Set `LLM_MODEL` to the model you want to use:

```bash
LLM_MODEL="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

```

3. Set `LLM_API_KEY` to your API key:

```bash
LLM_API_KEY="sk_test_12345"
```

4. Run the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run -it \
    --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.16-nikolaik \
    -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
    -e WORKSPACE_MOUNT_PATH=$WORKSPACE_BASE \
    -e LLM_API_KEY=$LLM_API_KEY \
    -e LLM_MODEL=$LLM_MODEL \
    -v $WORKSPACE_BASE:/opt/workspace_base \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.16 \
    python -m openhands.core.cli
```

This command will start an interactive session in Docker where you can input tasks and receive responses from OpenHands.
