# ðŸš§ Troubleshooting

There are some error messages that frequently get reported by users.
We'll try to make the install process easier, but for now you can look for your error message below and see if there are any workarounds.
If you find more information or a workaround for one of these issues, please open a *PR* to add details to this file.

:::tip
OpenHands only supports Windows via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Please be sure to run all commands inside your WSL terminal.

## Common Issues

* [Unable to connect to Docker](#unable-to-connect-to-docker)
* [404 Resource not found](#404-resource-not-found)
* [`make build` getting stuck on package installations](#make-build-getting-stuck-on-package-installations)
* [Sessions are not restored](#sessions-are-not-restored)
* [Connection to host.docker.internal timed out](#connection-to-host-docker-internal-timed-out)

### Unable to connect to Docker

[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/1226)

**Symptoms**

```bash
Error creating controller. Please check Docker is running and visit `https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/troubleshooting` for more debugging information.
```

```bash
docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory'))
```

**Details**

OpenHands uses a Docker container to do its work safely, without potentially breaking your machine.

**Workarounds**

* Run `docker ps` to ensure that docker is running
* Make sure you don't need `sudo` to run docker [see here](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/docker-run-without-sudo)
* If you are on a Mac, check the [permissions requirements](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/permission-requirements/) and in particular consider enabling the `Allow the default Docker socket to be used` under `Settings > Advanced` in Docker Desktop.
* In addition, upgrade your Docker to the latest version under `Check for Updates`

### `404 Resource not found`

**Symptoms**

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise e

    raise self._make_status_error_from_response(err.response) from None
openai.NotFoundError: Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': '404', 'message': 'Resource not found'}}
```

**Details**

This happens when LiteLLM (our library for connecting to different LLM providers) can't find
the API endpoint you're trying to connect to. Most often this happens for Azure or ollama users.

**Workarounds**

* Check that you've set `LLM_BASE_URL` properly
* Check that the model is set properly, based on the [LiteLLM docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)
  * If you're running inside the UI, be sure to set the `model` in the settings modal
  * If you're running headless (via main.py) be sure to set `LLM_MODEL` in your env/config
* Make sure you've followed any special instructions for your LLM provider
  * [Azure](/modules/usage/llms/azure-llms)
  * [Google](/modules/usage/llms/google-llms)
* Make sure your API key is correct
* See if you can connect to the LLM using `curl`
* Try [connecting via LiteLLM directly](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to test your setup

### `make build` getting stuck on package installations

**Symptoms**

Package installation stuck on `Pending...` without any error message:

```bash
Package operations: 286 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals

  - Installing certifi (2024.2.2): Pending...
  - Installing h11 (0.14.0): Pending...
  - Installing idna (3.7): Pending...
  - Installing sniffio (1.3.1): Pending...
  - Installing typing-extensions (4.11.0): Pending...
```

**Details**

In rare cases, `make build` can seemingly get stuck on package installations
without any error message.

**Workarounds**

The package installer Poetry may miss a configuration setting for where credentials are to be looked up (keyring).

First check with `env` if a value for `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND` exists.
If not, run the below command to set it to a known value and retry the build:

```bash
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
```

### Sessions are not restored

**Symptoms**

OpenHands usually asks whether to resume or start a new session when opening the UI.
But clicking "Resume" still starts a fresh new chat.

**Details**

With a standard installation as of today session data is stored in memory.
Currently, if OpenHands's service is restarted, previous sessions become
invalid (a new secret is generated) and thus not recoverable.

**Workarounds**

* Change configuration to make sessions persistent by editing the `config.toml`
file (in OpenHands's root folder) by specifying a `file_store` and an
absolute `file_store_path`:

```toml
file_store="local"
file_store_path="/absolute/path/to/openhands/cache/directory"
```

* Add a fixed jwt secret in your .bashrc, like below, so that previous session id's
should stay accepted.

```bash
EXPORT JWT_SECRET=A_CONST_VALUE
```

### Connection to host docker internal timed out

**Symptoms**

When you start the server using the docker command from the main [README](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/README.md), you get a long timeout
followed by the a stack trace containing messages like:

* `Connection to host.docker.internal timed out. (connect timeout=310)`
* `Max retries exceeded with url: /alive`

**Details**

If Docker Engine is installed rather than Docker Desktop, the main command will not work as expected.
Docker Desktop includes easy DNS configuration for connecting processes running in different containers
which OpenHands makes use of when the main server is running inside a docker container.
(Further details: https://forums.docker.com/t/difference-between-docker-desktop-and-docker-engine/124612)

**Workarounds**

* [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* Run OpenHands in [Development Mode](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md),
  So that the main server is not run inside a container, but still creates dockerized runtime sandboxes.
