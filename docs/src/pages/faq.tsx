              represents a cutting-edge autonomous agent designed to navigate the
              complexities of software engineering. It leverages a combination of
              tools such as a shell, code editor, and web browser, showcasing the
              untapped potential of LLMs in software development. Our goal is to
              explore and expand upon Devin's capabilities, identifying both its
              strengths and areas for improvement, to guide the progress of open
              code models.

            <div className="faq-steps">
              To fix an issue on GitHub using OpenDevin, send a prompt to OpenDevin asking it to follow these steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Read the issue on <a href="https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/issues/1611">GitHub</a></li>
                <li>Clone the repository and check out a new branch</li>
                <li>Based on the instructions in the issue description, modify files to fix the issue</li>
                <li>Push the resulting output to GitHub using the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable</li>
                <li>Tell me the link that I need to go to to send a pull request</li>
              </ol>
              Before you run OpenDevin, you can do:
              <div className="command-box">
                export SANDBOX_ENV_GITHUB_TOKEN=XXX
              </div>
              where XXX is a GitHub token that you created that has permissions to push to the OpenDevin repo. If you donâ€™t have write permission to the OpenDevin repo, you might need to change that to:
              <div className="command-box">
                Push the resulting output to my fork at https://github.com/USERNAME/OpenDevin/ using the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
              </div>
              where USERNAME is your GitHub username.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </Layout>
    </>
  );
