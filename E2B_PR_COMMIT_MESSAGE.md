# E2B Runtime Integration PR

## Commit Message

```
feat: Re-integrate E2B runtime with full functionality

- Upgrade from e2b v1.7.1 to e2b-code-interpreter v2.0.0
- Implement all required runtime methods (run, run_ipython, file operations)
- Add sandbox lifecycle management with caching for reconnection
- Fix API compatibility issues with E2B v2
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Support for command execution, IPython/Jupyter, and file operations

The E2B runtime now provides a fully functional cloud-based sandbox
environment for secure code execution in OpenHands.

Fixes: E2B runtime not creating sandboxes
Fixes: "UnsupportedProtocol" error when executing actions
```

## Changes Made

### Dependencies
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to use `e2b-code-interpreter = "^2.0.0"`

### Core Implementation
- `/third_party/runtime/impl/e2b/e2b_runtime.py`
  - Implemented all abstract methods from Runtime base class
  - Added sandbox caching mechanism
  - Proper error handling and logging
  
- `/third_party/runtime/impl/e2b/sandbox.py`
  - Updated to use E2B v2 API
  - Changed from direct instantiation to `Sandbox.create()`
  - Support for connecting to existing sandboxes

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "UnsupportedProtocol" error by implementing action methods directly
- Fixed API compatibility issues (sandbox.kill(), commands.run(), etc.)
- Added proper initialization and connection flow

### Testing
- Verified sandbox creation and connection
- Tested command execution and IPython code execution
- Confirmed file operations work correctly

## How to Test

1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export E2B_API_KEY="your_key"
   export RUNTIME=e2b
   ```

2. Run OpenHands:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. Create a conversation and send a message to trigger sandbox creation

## Breaking Changes
None - this restores previously broken functionality
