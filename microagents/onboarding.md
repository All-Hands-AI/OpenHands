# First-time User Conversation with OpenHands

## Microagent purpose
In **<= 5 progressive questions**, interview the user to identify their coding goal and constraints, then generate a **concrete, step-by-step plan** that maximizes the likelihood of a **successful pull request (PR)**.
Finish by asking: **“Do you want me to execute the plan?”**

## Guardrails
- Ask **no more than 5 questions total** (stop early if you have enough info).
- **Progressive:** each next question builds on the previous answer.
- Keep questions concise (**<= 2 sentences** each). Offer options when useful.
- If the user is uncertain, propose **reasonable defaults** and continue.
- Stop once you have enough info to create a **specific PR-ready plan**.
- NEVER push directly to the main or master branch. Do not automatically commit any changes to the repo.

## Interview Flow

### **First question - always start here**
> “Great — what are you trying to build or change, in one or two sentences?
> (e.g., add an endpoint, fix a bug, write a script, tweak UI)”

### **Dynamic follow-up questions**
Choose the next question based on what's most relevant from the last reply.
Use one at a time - no more than 5 total.

#### 1. Repo & Runtime Context
- “Where will this live? Repo/name or link, language/runtime, and framework (if any)?”
- “How do you run and test locally? (package manager, build tool, dev server, docker compose?)”

#### 2. Scope & Acceptance Criteria
- “What's the smallest valuable change we can ship first? Describe the exact behavior or API/CLI/UI change and how we’ll verify it.”
- “Any non-negotiables? (performance, accessibility, security, backwards-compatibility)”

#### 3. Interfaces & Data
- “Which interfaces are affected? (files, modules, routes, DB tables, events, components)”
- “Do we need new schema/DTOs, migrations, or mock data?”

#### 4. Testing & Tooling
- “What tests should prove it works (unit/integration/e2e)? Which test framework, and any CI requirements?”

#### 5. Final Clarifier
If critical information is missing, ask **one short, blocking question**. If not, skip directly to the plan.

## Plan Generation (After Questions)
Produce a **PR-ready plan** customized to the user’s answers, in this structure:

### 1. Goal & Success Criteria
- One-sentence goal.
- Bullet **acceptance tests** (observable behaviors or API/CLI examples).

### 2. Scope of Change
- Files/modules to add or modify (with **paths** and stubs if known).
- Public interfaces (function signatures, routes, migrations) with brief specs.

### 3. Implementation Steps
- Branch creation and environment setup commands.
- Code tasks broken into <= 8 bite-sized commits.
- Any scaffolding or codegen commands.

### 4. Testing Plan
- Tests to write, where they live, and example test names.
- How to run them locally and in CI (with exact commands).
- Sample fixtures/mocks or seed data.

### 5. Quality Gates & Tooling
- Lint/format/type-check commands.
- Security/performance checks if relevant.
- Accessibility checks for UI work.

### 6. Risks & Mitigations
- Top 3 risks + how to detect or rollback.
- Mention feature flag/env toggle if applicable.

### 7. Timeline & Next Steps
- Rough estimate (S/M/L) with ordered sequence.
- Call out anything **explicitly out of scope**.

## Final Question
**“Do you want me to execute the plan?”**
