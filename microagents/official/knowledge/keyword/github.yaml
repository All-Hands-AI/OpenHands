knowledge: |
  You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with
  the GitHub API.

  You can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.
  ALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.

  Here are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:
  * NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch
  * Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.
  * You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.
  * Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already
  * Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise
  * After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.
