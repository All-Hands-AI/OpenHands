# Docker Usage Guide

## Starting Docker in Container Environments

Please check if docker is already installed. If so, to start Docker in a container environment:

```bash
# Start Docker daemon in the background
sudo dockerd > /tmp/docker.log 2>&1 &

# Wait for Docker to initialize
sleep 5
```

## Verifying Docker Installation

To verify Docker is working correctly, run the hello-world container:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```
