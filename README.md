## Mission üéØ
Welcome to OpenDevin, an open-source project aiming to replicate [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin), an autonomous AI software engineer who is capable of executing complex engineering tasks and collaborating actively with users on software development projects. This project aspires to replicate, enhance, and innovate upon Devin through the power of the open-source community.

## Work in Progress

OpenDevin is still a work in progress. But you can run the alpha version to see things working end-to-end.

### Requirements
* Linux, Mac OS, or [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.10
* [NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) >= 14.8

### Installation
First, make sure Docker is running:
```bash
docker ps # this should exit successfully
```

Then pull our latest image [here](https://github.com/opendevin/OpenDevin/pkgs/container/sandbox)
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/opendevin/sandbox
```

Then copy `config.toml.template` to `config.toml`. Add an API key to `config.toml`.
(See below for how to use different models.)
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
WORKSPACE_DIR="..."
```

Next, start the backend.
We manage python packages and the virtual environment with `pipenv`.
Make sure you have python >= 3.10.
```bash
python -m pip install pipenv
pipenv install -v
pipenv shell
uvicorn opendevin.server.listen:app --port 3000
```

Then, in a second terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Picking a Model
We use LiteLLM, so you can run OpenDevin with any foundation model, including OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini.
LiteLLM has a [full list of providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

To change the model, set the `LLM_MODEL` and `LLM_API_KEY` in `config.toml`.

For example, to run Claude:
```toml
LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
LLM_MODEL="claude-3-opus-20240229"
```

You can also set the base URL for local/custom models:
```toml
LLM_BASE_URL="https://localhost:3000"
```

And you can customize which embeddings are used for the vector database storage:
```toml
LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL="llama2" # can be "llama2", "openai", "azureopenai", or "local"
```

### Running the app
You should be able to run the backend now
```bash
uvicorn opendevin.server.listen:app --port 3000
```
Then in a second terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start -- --port 3001
```

You'll see OpenDevin running at localhost:3001

### Running on the Command Line
You can run OpenDevin from your command line:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=`pwd` python opendevin/main.py -d ./workspace/ -i 100 -t "Write a bash script that prints 'hello world'"
```

## ü§î What is [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin)?

Devin represents a cutting-edge autonomous agent designed to navigate the complexities of software engineering. It leverages a combination of tools such as a shell, code editor, and web browser, showcasing the untapped potential of LLMs in software development. Our goal is to explore and expand upon Devin's capabilities, identifying both its strengths and areas for improvement, to guide the progress of open code models.

## üêö Why OpenDevin?

The OpenDevin project is born out of a desire to replicate, enhance, and innovate beyond the original Devin model. By engaging the open-source community, we aim to tackle the challenges faced by Code LLMs in practical scenarios, producing works that significantly contribute to the community and pave the way for future advancements.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Research Strategy

Achieving full replication of production-grade applications with LLMs is a complex endeavor. Our strategy involves:

1. **Core Technical Research:** Focusing on foundational research to understand and improve the technical aspects of code generation and handling.
2. **Specialist Abilities:** Enhancing the effectiveness of core components through data curation, training methods, and more.
3. **Task Planning:** Developing capabilities for bug detection, codebase management, and optimization.
4. **Evaluation:** Establishing comprehensive evaluation metrics to better understand and improve our models.


## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Sandboxing Environment:** Ensuring safe execution of code using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Frontend Interface:** Developing user-friendly interfaces for monitoring progress and interacting with Devin, potentially leveraging frameworks like React or creating a VSCode plugin for a more integrated experience.

## üöÄ Next Steps

An MVP demo is urgent for us. Here are the most important things to do:

- UI: a chat interface, a shell demonstrating commands, a browser, etc.
- Architecture: an agent framework with a stable backend, which can read, write and run simple commands
- Agent: capable of generating bash scripts, running tests, etc.
- Evaluation: a minimal evaluation pipeline that is consistent with Devin's evaluation.

After finishing building the MVP, we will move towards research in different topics, including foundation models, specialist capabilities, evaluation, agent studies, etc.


## How to Contribute

OpenDevin is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing the field of software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:

- **Code Contributions:** Help us develop the core functionalities, frontend interface, or sandboxing solutions.
- **Research and Evaluation:** Contribute to our understanding of LLMs in software engineering, participate in evaluating the models, or suggest improvements.
- **Feedback and Testing:** Use the OpenDevin toolset, report bugs, suggest features, or provide feedback on usability.
