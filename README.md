Welcome to Open Hands, a platform for autonomous software engineers, powered by AI and LLMs.

Open Hands agents collaborate with human developers to write code, fix bugs, and ship features.

![App screenshot](./docs/static/img/screenshot.png)

## ‚ö° Getting Started
Open Hands works best with Docker version 26.0.0+ (Docker Desktop 4.31.0+).
You must be using Linux, Mac OS, or WSL on Windows.

To start Open Hands in a docker container, run the following commands in your terminal:

> [!WARNING]
> When you run the following command, files in `./workspace` may be modified or deleted.

```bash
WORKSPACE_BASE=$(pwd)/workspace
docker run -it \
    --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
    -e WORKSPACE_MOUNT_PATH=$WORKSPACE_BASE \
    -v $WORKSPACE_BASE:/opt/workspace_base \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
    ghcr.io/openhands/openhands:0.8
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, this command pulls the `latest` tag, which represents the most recent release of Open Hands. You have other options as well:
> - For a specific release version, use `ghcr.io/openhands/openhands:<Open Hands_version>` (replace <Open Hands_version> with the desired version number).
> - For the most up-to-date development version, use `ghcr.io/openhands/openhands:main`. This version may be **(unstable!)** and is recommended for testing or development purposes only.
>
> Choose the tag that best suits your needs based on stability requirements and desired features.

You'll find Open Hands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with access to `./workspace`. To have Open Hands operate on your code, place it in `./workspace`.
Open Hands will only have access to this workspace folder. The rest of your system will not be affected as it runs in a secured docker sandbox.

Upon opening Open Hands, you must select the appropriate `Model` and enter the `API Key` within the settings that should pop up automatically. These can be set at any time by selecting
the `Settings` button (gear icon) in the UI. If the required `Model` does not exist in the list, you can manually enter it in the text box.

For the development workflow, see [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).

Are you having trouble? Check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/troubleshooting).

## üöÄ Documentation

To learn more about the project, and for tips on using Open Hands,
**check out our [documentation](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/intro)**.

There you'll find resources on how to use different LLM providers (like ollama and Anthropic's Claude),
troubleshooting resources, and advanced configuration options.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Open Hands is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone.
Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing the field of
software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:
