# OpenDevin

## Mission 🎯
[Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin) is an autonomous agent 🤖 that tackles software engineering tasks through the use of its shell, code editor, and web browser. This rekindles the immense potential of LLMs in the software engineering domain, offering a new beacon of hope. This project aspires to replicate, enhance, and innovate upon Devin through the power of the open-source community.
