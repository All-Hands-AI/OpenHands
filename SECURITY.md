# Security Policy

**Please send all vulnerability reports to contact@all-hands.dev in addition to opening a security advisory on GitHub.**

## Security/Bugfix Versions
Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the most recent version of OpenHands. Fixes are released either as part of the next minor version or as an on-demand patch version.
Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you find something suspicious, we encourage and appreciate your report!

### Ways to report
In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

In addition, please also reach out to the All Hands AI security team at contact@all-hands.dev.
