## TASK

IMPORTANT: re-read vscode.md to understand the big picture here. We are on task 2, vscode-runtime. And now... I just rebased the branch vscode-runtime on top of the task 1 branch, the vscode-integration. That means we can kill some redundancy, because on our runtime branch we actually even had some incipient extension scaffolding, and we have code. Please make yourself a task.md file for what is ahead of us: we need to understand the extension structure that came now on branch, it's in integrations/vscode, understand the extension scaffolding and code here, in openhands/runtime/utils/vscode-extensions/openhands-runtime/README.md , then start to migrate our important files (such as our actual implementation for the vscode side of the runtime, which is in openhands/runtime/utils/vscode-extensions/openhands-runtime/src/extension/services/socket-service
.ts and openhands/runtime/utils/vscode-extensions/openhands-runtime/src/extension/services/vscodeRuntimeActionHandler.ts , and migrate it to the extension in integrations! Please write the task.md file carefully with enough details for the whole migration/cleanup process, so that we know what to
 do and don't lose files. It's important!
