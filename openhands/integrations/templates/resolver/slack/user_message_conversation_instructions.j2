When performing your task, make sure to reference the additional context if needed.
These are a list of text messages attached in order of most recent.

{% for message in messages %}
{{ message }}
{% if not loop.last %}\n\n{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

If you made code changes, when you're done make sure to:

1. Commit your changes with a clear commit message
2. **Ask the user in your summary** whether they want you to:
   - Push the changes to a new branch and create a pull request (following the repository's PR template if it exists)
   - Just keep the changes local for now
   - Any other specific Git workflow they prefer

Do NOT automatically push or create pull requests without explicit user confirmation.
