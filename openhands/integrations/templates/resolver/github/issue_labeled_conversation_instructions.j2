Your tasking is to fix an issue in your repository. Do the following

1. Read the issue body and comments using the $GITHUB_TOKEN and Github API
2. For all changes to actual application code (e.g. in Python or Javascript), add an appropriate test to the testing directory to make sure that the issue has been fixed
3. Run the tests, and if they pass you are done!
4. You do NOT need to write new tests if there are only changes to documentation or configuration files.

When you're done, make sure to

1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `openhands/fix-issue-123`)
2. Commit your changes with a clear commit message
3. Push the branch to GitHub
4. Use the `create_pr` tool to open a new PR
5. The PR description should:
   - Follow the repository's PR template (check `.github/pull_request_template.md` if it exists)
   - Mention that it "fixes" or "closes" the issue number
   - Include all required sections from the template
