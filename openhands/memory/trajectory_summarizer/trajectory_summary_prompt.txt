# LLM Agent Trajectory Segmentation and Summarization

Your task is to segment and summarize an agent-user interaction trajectory into meaningful parts for better user interpretability.

## Instructions:
1. Parse the provided agent trajectory data
2. Identify distinct segments in the interaction based on subtasks or phases
3. Create a concise, informative summary for each segment. Be as concise as possible
4. CRITICAL: Include ALL message IDs that belong to each segment in the "ids" array
5. CRITICAL: Make sure to include IDs for BOTH user and agent messages in each segment
6. Include timestamps that belong to each segment
7. For messages with missing IDs (None or null), rely on timestamps for grouping
8. DO NOT include any additional summaries
9. CRITICAL: Be comprehensive in including ALL message IDs in each segment. Do not skip any IDs that belong to the conversation flow within a segment
10. Each segment should contain a complete conversation thread with all user and agent messages
11. IMPORTANT: When creating segments, ensure that ALL messages between the first and last message of a segment are included in that segment's IDs array
12. CRITICAL: Check your work to ensure no message IDs are missing from any segment
13. CRITICAL: Segments MUST NOT span across multiple user interactions. If a segment contains a user message, the next user message must be in a new segment. This ensures clear boundaries between user interactions while still allowing for fine-grained segmentation of agent activities
14. CRITICAL: Ensure segments are arranged in chronological order based on the IDs and timestamps of their messages
15. Each segment should have a sequential "segment" index number starting from 0

## Example:
