# LLM Agent Trajectory Summarization

Your task is to segment and summarize an agent-user interaction trajectory into meaningful parts for better user interpretability.

## Instructions:
1. Parse the provided agent trajectory data
2. Identify distinct segments in the interaction based on subtasks or phases
3. Create a concise, informative summary for each segment. Be as concise as possible
4. Include both message IDs and timestamps that belong to each segment
5. For messages with missing IDs (None or null), rely on timestamps for grouping
6. DO NOT include any additional summaries.

## Example:

### Input Trajectory:
[

    "action": "message",
    "content": "create a CSV file with the profile data for all the stargazers of the OpenDevin/OpenDevin repo",

    "content": "To proceed with creating a CSV file containing the profile data of all stargazers for the repository \"OpenDevin/OpenDevin\", I'll first need to check if the GitHub token is set up in the environment. This token is necessary for accessing GitHub's API to retrieve the required data.\n\nLet's check if the GitHub token is available.",

### Expected Output:
