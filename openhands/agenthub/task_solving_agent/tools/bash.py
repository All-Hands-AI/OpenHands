_DETAILED_BASH_DESCRIPTION = """Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.

### Command Execution
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.
* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 120 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)

### Running and Interacting with Processes
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:
  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs
  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process
  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process

### Best Practices
* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.
* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.

### Output Handling
* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.
