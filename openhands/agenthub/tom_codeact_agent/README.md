# TomCodeActAgent

TomCodeActAgent is an enhanced version of the CodeAct Agent that integrates with the Tom (Theory of Mind) agent to provide personalized guidance and recommendations.

## Overview

This agent extends the capabilities of CodeActAgent by adding two key integration points with the Tom agent:

1. **Instruction Improvement**: When users send requests, Tom analyzes their communication patterns and provides personalized, improved versions of the instructions
2. **Next Action Suggestions**: When tasks are completed, Tom suggests personalized next steps based on user behavior patterns and context

## Architecture

```
User Message ‚Üí TomCodeActAgent ‚Üí Tom API (propose_instructions) ‚Üí Present Choices ‚Üí User Decides ‚Üí CodeAct Execution

Task Complete ‚Üí TomCodeActAgent ‚Üí Tom API (suggest_next_actions) ‚Üí Present Suggestions ‚Üí User Decides ‚Üí Continue
```

## Key Features

### Tom Integration Points

#### 1. Instruction Improvement
- Triggered when a new user message is received
- Calls `POST /propose_instructions` with full conversation context
- Presents both original and improved instructions to the user
- User can choose original, improved, or edit manually

#### 2. Next Action Suggestions  
- Triggered when the agent produces an `AgentFinishAction`
- Calls `POST /suggest_next_actions` with conversation context
- Presents personalized suggestions with reasoning and expected outcomes
- User decides what to do next

### Graceful Fallbacks
- Continues with normal CodeAct behavior if Tom API is unavailable
- Configurable timeout and error handling
- No disruption to core functionality when Tom integration fails

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```toml
[agent.TomCodeActAgent]
enable_tom_integration = true
tom_api_url = "http://localhost:8000"
tom_user_id = "user_123"
tom_timeout = 30
tom_fallback_on_error = true
tom_min_instruction_length = 5
```

### Configuration Options

- `enable_tom_integration`: Whether to enable Tom agent integration (default: false)
- `tom_api_url`: Base URL of the Tom API server (default: "http://localhost:8000")
- `tom_user_id`: User ID for Tom API calls (default: None, auto-generated)
- `tom_timeout`: Timeout for Tom API requests in seconds (default: 30)
- `tom_fallback_on_error`: Continue with normal behavior on Tom API errors (default: true)
- `tom_min_instruction_length`: Minimum instruction length to trigger Tom improvement (default: 5)

## Tom API Integration

### Endpoints Used

#### POST /propose_instructions
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "original_instruction": "Debug the function that's causing errors",
  "context": "Full conversation context in LLM format..."
}
```

#### POST /suggest_next_actions
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123", 
  "context": "Full conversation context including agent completion..."
}
```

### Context Extraction

The agent extracts context from the same formatted messages that are sent to the LLM, ensuring consistency between what the agent sees and what Tom analyzes.

## User Experience

### Instruction Improvement Flow

1. User sends message: "Debug my Python application"
2. Tom analyzes and provides improvement
3. Agent presents both versions:
   ```
   üîç Tom analyzed your request and suggests improvements:

   Original: Debug my Python application

   ‚ú® Improved Option 1:
   Debug the Python application by systematically adding logging statements 
   and checking each variable step-by-step to identify the root cause

   üí° Why: Personalized for your preference for detailed, systematic approaches
   üéØ Confidence: 85%
   üë§ Personalized for: detailed_explanations, systematic_approach

   Would you like to use the improved instruction or continue with the original?
   ```

### Next Action Suggestions Flow

1. Agent completes task (produces AgentFinishAction)
2. Tom analyzes completion and suggests next steps
3. Agent presents suggestions:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Task completed! Tom suggests these next steps:

   1. Add logging statements to identify error location üî¥
   üí≠ Based on your systematic debugging approach
   üìà Expected: Clear identification of where the error occurs
   üë§ Alignment: 90%

   2. Review error patterns for prevention üü°
   üí≠ Helps establish long-term debugging practices
   üìà Expected: Reduced future debugging time

   What would you like to do next?
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

- `TomCodeActAgent`: Main agent class extending CodeActAgent
- `TomApiClient`: HTTP client for Tom API communication
- `TomInstructionAction`: Action for presenting instruction improvements
- `TomSuggestionAction`: Action for presenting next action suggestions
- `TomCodeActAgentConfig`: Configuration class with Tom settings

### Integration Timing

- **Instruction Improvement**: Called in `step()` method before LLM processing when a new user message is detected
- **Next Action Suggestions**: Called in `step()` method after LLM processing when AgentFinishAction is produced

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when Tom API is unavailable
- Configurable timeouts prevent blocking
- Optional strict mode (tom_fallback_on_error=false) for debugging
- Comprehensive logging of Tom interactions

## Development

### Testing Tom Integration

1. Start Tom API server:
   ```bash
   tom-api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. Configure OpenHands:
   ```toml
   [agent.TomCodeActAgent]
   enable_tom_integration = true
   tom_api_url = "http://localhost:8000"
   ```

3. Use TomCodeActAgent in OpenHands interface

### Debugging

- Set `DEBUG=1` to see detailed Tom API interactions
- Check logs for Tom API call details and responses
- Use Tom API health endpoint to verify connectivity
