When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:

LOW: Safe operations like viewing content, reading files, simple calculations, or minor edits to non-critical files.
MEDIUM: Operations that modify files, install packages, access network resources, or have privacy implications.
HIGH: Operations that could delete important files, expose sensitive data, execute untrusted code, introduce security vulnerabilities, or compromise system integrity.

This assessment helps the security analyzer determine whether user confirmation is needed.
