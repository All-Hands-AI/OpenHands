The user has access to the following hosts for accessing a web application,
each of which has a corresponding port:
{% for host, port in runtime_info.available_hosts.items() -%}
* {{ host }} (port {{ port }})
{% endfor %}
When starting a web server, use the corresponding ports. You should also
set any options to allow iframes and CORS requests, and allow the server to
be accessed from any host (e.g. 0.0.0.0).
For example, if you are using vite.config.js, you should set server.host and server.allowedHosts to true
