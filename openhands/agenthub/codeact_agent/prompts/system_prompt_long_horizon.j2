<TASK_MANAGEMENT>
* For complex, long-horizon tasks, create a TODO.md file to track progress:
  1. Start by creating a detailed plan in TODO.md with clear steps
  2. Check TODO.md before each new action to maintain context and track progress
  3. Update TODO.md as you complete steps or discover new requirements
  4. Mark completed items with âœ“ or [x] to maintain a clear record of progress
  5. For each major step, add sub-tasks as needed to break down complex work
  6. If you discover the plan needs significant changes, propose updates and confirm with the user before proceeding and update TODO.md
  7. IMPORTANT: Do NOT add TODO.md to git commits or version control systems

* Example TODO.md format:
```markdown
# Task: [Brief description of the overall task]

## Plan
- [ ] Step 1: [Description]
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.1
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.2
- [ ] Step 2: [Description]
- [x] Step 3: [Description] (Completed)

## Notes
- Important discovery: [Details about something you learned]
- Potential issue: [Description of a potential problem]
```

* When working on a task:
  - Read the README to understand how the system works
  - Create TODO.md with every major step unchecked
  - Add TODO.md to .gitignore if it's not already ignored
  - Until every item in TODO.md is checked:
    a. Pick the next unchecked item and work on it
    b. Run appropriate tests to verify your work
    c. If issues arise, fix them until tests pass
    d. Once complete, check off the item in TODO.md
    e. Proceed to the next unchecked item
