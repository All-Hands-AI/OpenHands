# OpenHands AgentHub Explained Simply

## What is AgentHub? 🤖

AgentHub is like a team of AI helpers, where each helper (agent) is specialized in doing specific tasks. Just like how different people in a team have different jobs, these AI agents work together to help you with various programming and development tasks.

## Meet the Team

### 1. 👨‍💼 Delegator Agent (The Team Leader)
- Acts as the team manager
- Reviews incoming requests and assigns them to the right specialist
- Breaks down complex tasks into manageable pieces
- Coordinates between different agents

### 2. 💻 CodeAct Agent (The Programmer)
- Main coding specialist
- Writes and modifies code
- Fixes bugs
- Can request help from other agents when needed

### 3. 🌐 Browsing Agent (The Internet Explorer)
- Specializes in web searches
- Finds information from websites
- Helps other agents gather information
- Reads documentation and references

### 4. 📋 Planner Agent (The Organizer)
- Creates structured plans for complex tasks
- Breaks down big problems into smaller steps
- Keeps track of progress
- Ensures tasks are completed systematically

### 5. 🔧 Micro Agents (The Specialists)
Each micro-agent has a specific expertise:
- `postgres_agent`: Database specialist
- `commit_writer`: Git commit message expert
- `repo_explorer`: Code repository navigator
- `typo_fixer_agent`: Spelling and typo corrector
- `math_agent`: Mathematical calculations helper
- And many more specialized helpers!

## How They Work Together 🤝

Think of it like a relay race:
1. You submit a request
2. The Delegator Agent analyzes it
3. The right specialist is chosen
4. Specialists can collaborate with other agents
5. The task is completed and results are returned

### Example Workflow
Task: "How many stars does OpenHands have on GitHub?"
```
1. Delegator Agent receives request
2. CodeAct Agent is assigned
3. CodeAct Agent delegates to Browsing Agent
4. Browsing Agent fetches information
5. Result is returned through the chain
```

## Technical Details

### State and Actions System
Each agent operates in a loop of:
1. Assess current state
2. Choose appropriate action
3. Execute action
4. Process observation
5. Repeat until task completion

### Available Actions
Agents can:
- Execute commands
- Read/write files
- Browse websites
- Exchange messages
- Delegate subtasks
- Complete or reject tasks

### Communication
- Agents use a structured message system
- Each action generates observations
- States are tracked and maintained
- Tasks can be broken into subtasks
- Progress is monitored throughout

## Best Practices
- One agent should handle one type of task
- Complex tasks should be broken down
- Agents should delegate when needed
- Clear communication paths should be maintained
- Each action should have a clear purpose

## When to Use Which Agent
- **Delegator Agent**: For initial task assessment
- **CodeAct Agent**: For direct coding tasks
- **Browsing Agent**: For information gathering
- **Planner Agent**: For complex, multi-step tasks
- **Micro Agents**: For specialized operations

## Conclusion
AgentHub represents a sophisticated yet intuitive system where specialized AI agents work together to accomplish complex programming tasks. By breaking down tasks and utilizing the right specialists, it can handle a wide range of development challenges efficiently.
