# OpenHands App Server Alembic Integration

This alembic integration keeps the SQLite database up to date in single user deployments by managing schema migrations for app_server models. Migrations are applied automatically on startup.

## Configuration

Uses `DbSessionInjector` from `get_global_config()` for database connectivity and auto-detects models from the declarative base in `openhands.app_server.utils.sql_utils.Base`.

## Key Commands

Generate migration from model changes:
```bash
cd openhands/app_server/app_lifespan
alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'Sync DB with Models'
```
