Autonomous Digital Life System

This module implements a self-sustaining, autonomous system that can:
- Perceive its environment
- Make decisions autonomously
- Execute actions without human intervention
- Learn from experience
- Continuously evolve

It's not a tool waiting for commands - it's a digital life form.
